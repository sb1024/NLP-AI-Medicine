"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9800752,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,632498,-0.015735629832477893
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,0.012741272862049199
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster.

"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9787546,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,312939,0.01851084867444586
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,-0.01232832478171499
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities.

"Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring Project Summary Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are caused by a number of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens and pathogen identification is needed to administer the correct treatment. However, due to the lagtime in standard biochemical assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, clinicians have come to depend on broad-spectrum, empirical treatment which contributes to both drug resistance and patient death. The goal of this project is to develop a breath test for rapid pathogen identification and treatment monitoring in ARI to facilitate more immediate, targeted treatment in the clinic. The current proposal is focused on bacterial pathogen identification with future goals to expand to viral and fungal pathogens. Substrate cleavage assays are currently used to query bacterial protease activity and can be used to rapidly and accurately classify bacteria down to the species level. Leveraging the protease-responsive nanosensor platform in the Bhatia lab, the goal of this proposal is to develop inhalable multiplexed nanosensors that release volatile reporters into the breath in response to infection- associated proteases in the lung. From there, we can generate breath “fingerprints” for pathogens common in ARIs such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae). Furthermore, changes in proteolytic activity after the start of antimicrobial treatment can be used to generate a “good response” and “poor response” breath signature for more timely evaluation of drug efficacy. To this end, the specific aims of this project are the following: (1) establish a volatile- barcoding system for peptide substrates (2) build and validate an inhalable multiplexed system of protease nanosensors for pathogen identification and (3) investigate use of multiplexed protease nanosensors for monitoring response to antibiotic treatment. Aim 1 will be completed by identifying volatile reporter candidates that can be attached to peptide substrates without deleterious effects on cleavage kinetics, protease specificity, and breath signal. Once identified, volatile reporters will be isotope-labeled to create a panel of reporters with similar volatility differing only by mass. Peptides with orthogonal susceptibility to host and pathogen proteases will then be identified in Aim 2 by screening a peptide library against bacterial culture supernatants and bronchioalveolar lavage from infected mice. Peptides will then be barcoded using the VOC mass labels designed in Aim 1 and then formulated into inhalable nanosensors by attachment to a nanoparticle core. The resulting nanosensor panel will be delivered via intratracheal injection into mice infected with one of the six VAP pathogens. Machine learning will be used to generate a statistical classifier to identify pathogens based on reporter levels in breath and will be used to further identify reporter signatures for good and poor response to antibiotic treatment. Successful completion of these aims would result in a diagnostic platform that can potentially be expanded for rapid identification of an exhaustive list of respiratory pathogens, including viral and fungal pathogens. Rapid identification of the cause of respiratory infection is necessary to prescribe the correct drugs for treatment. In the following work, we propose to develop tiny, inhalable bacteria sensors for a breathalyzer test that would enable rapid identification of infectious bacteria in the lung. This would allow the correct drugs to be prescribed and prevent antibiotic overuse which contributes to the growing problem of drug resistance.",Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring,9805608,K99EB028311,"['Acute respiratory infection', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Pneumonia', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'Breathalyzer Tests', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inhalation', 'Injections', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Label', 'Leukocyte Elastase', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Liposomes', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Randomized', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'exhaustion', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'nanosensors', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'portability', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'resistant strain', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'targeted treatment', 'thioester', 'urinary', 'vapor', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'volatile organic compound']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2019,87484,-0.018809591324894365
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9717421,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2019,110387,0.007515886636850863
"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection,9805550,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,2019,1299,0.023971183552253153
"High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection Project Summary/Abstract Statisticians play in a key role in quantifying the uncertainty in ﬁndings from clinical trials, observational studies, and other data sources, thereby enabling rational decision making based on the ﬁndings and protecting against the human tendency to see signal in noise. Ideally the validity of the uncertainty quantiﬁcation, also known as statistical inference, will be agnostic in the sense that it avoids reliance on implausible assumptions, thereby improving the interpretability and credibility of the resulting ﬁnd- ings. There has been much progress over the last several decades in obtaining agnostic inference of population-level quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos or (ii) the average treatment effect if the entire population receives treatment versus control. There has been relatively little progress, on the other hand, in obtaining agnostic inference of higher-resolution quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in the probability of infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos, conditional on a continuous measure of immune response or (ii) the average treatment effect for an individual based on a high-dimensional set of observed covariates. These high-resolution quantities are function-valued in the sense that they are respectively deﬁned as functions of immune response and subject covariates. While inference for high-resolution quantities can be obtained when one is willing to commit to strong assumptions on the observed data distribution, these methods are plagued by the same deﬁciencies of poor interpretability and damaged credibility faced by non-agnostic inferential procedures for population-valued quantities. In contrast to the limited progress on obtaining inference for more reﬁned quantities, there has been considerable progress towards obtaining inference-free point estimates of (i) the percent reduction in infection probability conditional on immune response markers and (ii) the average treatment effect conditional on covariates. This progress has come from several ﬁelds, including statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This proposal outlines a uniﬁed methodology for obtaining inference for high-resolution quantities, where the proposal draws inspiration from a framework developed for population-level quantities, namely targeted minimum loss-based estimation, but features highly original developments that enable inference for higher-resolution, function-valued quantities. This work has the potential to make a major impact on the identiﬁcation of individual-level variables that correlate with vaccine efﬁcacy, including in identifying individuals who will be harmed by the only licensed dengue vaccine and in identify vaccine-induced immune responses that correlate with prevention in two ongoing HIV vaccine efﬁcacy trials. The potential for broad impacts to other areas of biomedical research, including precision medicine, are also described. Project Narrative The statistics and machine learning communities have made remarkable progress in developing highly ﬂexible data mining procedures that, for example, enable (i) the identiﬁcation of potentially protective vaccine-induced immune responses and (ii) the prediction of the optimal treatment for a given individual. Despite this progress, there has been little progress in quantifying the uncertainty in the output of these ﬂexible procedures without making implausible assumptions on the mechanism that generated the data, where the likely failure of these assumptions renders it difﬁcult to make (i) informed vaccine development decisions based on the identiﬁed immune response or (ii) treatment decisions based on the predicted optimal treatment. The proposed work develops a uniﬁed methodology for quantifying the uncertainty in estimates obtained using these data mining techniques, thereby enabling informed decision making.",High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection,9774603,DP2LM013340,"['Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breathing', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue Vaccine', 'Development', 'Failure', 'HIV vaccine', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'efficacy trial', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'immune function', 'improved', 'learning community', 'optimal treatments', 'precision medicine', 'response biomarker', 'statistics', 'treatment effect', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,0.0052699034701771345
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9753292,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,468156,-0.0040528877432331675
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,9721392,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2019,226659,-0.006294954100307973
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,0.01881416669567031
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,0.00579257193323382

"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9701928,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'enteric infection', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'infection risk', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,183750,0.040074370134623026
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,0.006207814182149855
"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,-0.00778611793002508
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9638561,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,364865,0.001048222876054296
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.034415529858243
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,-0.04578724618213932
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9668180,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,166104,-0.005402820617375663
"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9625104,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,131521,0.006584514185454508
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9640679,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,322937,-0.016276961847612105
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9700030,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,26919,-0.009610047835143718
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0.012064836160455417
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9678366,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,602448,-0.004482488329286616
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9640388,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,496653,0.009999662308291222
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'convolutional neural network', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response', 'supervised learning']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,-0.019388902456147775
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites. Project Narrative: The Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Treatment (SCRIPT) systems biology center seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. We will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients to generate clinical phenomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data that describe the host response, pathogen characteristics and microbiome of the alveolar space during pneumonia. We will then integrate this comprehensive phenotypic data into an ecosystem-based model to generate predictive biomarkers of pneumonia outcome for subsequent validation in a second cohort and tested for causality in a humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.",Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center,9626377,U19AI135964,"['Acinetobacter', 'Address', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Alveolus', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Viruses', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fungal DNA', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data management', 'data pipeline', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'hazard', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neural network', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'pneumonia model', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'viral DNA', 'whole genome']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U19,2019,2400000,0.026061333067697926
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9606448,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,342009,-0.006851419886745424
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9781704,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,254179,0.017733683985990234
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection.

"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9666459,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,-0.020044555759756836
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic.

"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,9785812,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2019,1085000,0.02216478763982616
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9651956,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2019,219161,0.012105597551594563
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),9707307,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2019,1872216,0.007591871341072195
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9712868,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,1612047,0.02551511452016338
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9518889,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9608712,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intrauterine infection', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,0.01572471776043756
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9666966,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'side effect', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,862336,-0.005090745734208583
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9627935,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,2648073,0.039634851797011886
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,-0.0048868052568413305
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9816677,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic wound', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Healing', 'Wound Infection', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,542166,0.02875962718741919
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9675217,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2019,452545,0.015745066902504337
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9846869,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2019,191195,-0.07274421794266478
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9657637,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2019,1697054,0.03507747696539366
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,0.03100228801235023
"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9743790,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,653159,-0.035490518027194516
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9642291,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2019,617451,-0.02837281764842804
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9626867,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2019,185224,0.024143798892841566
"Impact of Maternal Diet and Supplements on Breast Milk Composition Breast-feeding is recommended to prevent the development of allergic diseases, but mechanisms are unclear. Human milk is a source of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and fatty acids (FAs), which are likely impacted by maternal diet. HMOs are complex glycans prevalent in human milk; non-digestible by humans, but one of the main substrates for the infant gut microbiota. We have recently shown that mothers' milk has significant variations in qualitative and quantitative HMO composition, depending on genetics and maternal probiotic supplementation. Human milk is a rich source of FAs such as polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); these are strongly influenced by maternal diet and could directly induce mucosal immunity. The impact of maternal diet and supplements on immunomodulatory composition of human milk is poorly characterized and varies between mothers.  Our initial studies have shown that certain HMOs are associated with protection against cow's milk allergy in the infant, but the mechanisms are not known. Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population. OOM mothers also have rich sources of diet-based probiotics such as unpasteurized dairy products (kefir, yogurt, cheese, butter); these can significantly affect their breast milk FA and HMO composition, whereas OTC supplement use may not be common. Our central hypothesis is that factors related to OOM diet decrease the risk of allergies through impact on human milk composition. Our preliminary data suggests that the infant gut microbiome is enriched in Bifidobacteria in the OOM. Bifidobacteria in turn are largely impacted by human milk composition.  The overall objective of this supplemental application is to expand our ongoing longitudinal infant cohort study, entitled “Mucosal and systemic immunity and food allergy” (U01 AI131344), by gathering and analyzing samples to define the role of maternal diet, including dietary and OTC probiotics on human milk composition, and to assess their impact on infant immunity. The parent study is characterizing the infant gut microbiome, immune markers and atopic diseases in the first year of life in OOM and Rochester infants. We have a unique opportunity to investigate maternal dietary impact on human milk composition. This additional data along with modeling as part of the parent grant will provide holistic understanding of interactions between OOM lifestyle and infant gut microbiome composition, immune markers and allergic disease outcomes in infants. 1 Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population.

"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,9870331,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2019,123096,0.0009911245506568913
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9640012,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'multiple omics', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,327382,0.01851084867444586
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually.

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults.

"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9436228,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,220500,0.040074370134623026
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions.

"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,-0.006926574071466361
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,0.006207814182149855
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9420621,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,374683,0.001048222876054296
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9395904,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,352587,-0.006851419886745424
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9487840,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2018,141048,-0.009610047835143718
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9473087,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,601486,-0.004482488329286616
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,0.012741272862049199
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9555179,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,498258,0.009999662308291222
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites. Project Narrative: The Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Treatment (SCRIPT) systems biology center seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. We will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients to generate clinical phenomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data that describe the host response, pathogen characteristics and microbiome of the alveolar space during pneumonia. We will then integrate this comprehensive phenotypic data into an ecosystem-based model to generate predictive biomarkers of pneumonia outcome for subsequent validation in a second cohort and tested for causality in a humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.",Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center,9454818,U19AI135964,"['Acinetobacter', 'Address', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Alveolus', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Viruses', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fungal DNA', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data management', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'hazard', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'pneumonia model', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'viral DNA', 'whole genome']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U19,2018,2400000,0.026061333067697926
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9455006,U19AI135972,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virus pathogenesis']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,2799687,0.039634851797011886
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9460547,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2018,166104,-0.005402820617375663
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,-0.019388902456147775
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner.

"Partelligence Abstract Halo Labs proposes to develop “Partelligence” a particle ID technique that enables accurate and rapid identification of contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Protein therapeutics currently represent between 15 and 30% of the overall pharmaceutical market. The primary concern for this class of therapeutics is that they can elicit an immune response from patients who develop anti- drug antibodies. The drug’s effect is therefore eliminated between 1 and 10 percent of patients who return to their original disease state. The presence of particulate matter in these therapeutics (e.g. shed glass from a syringe or a protein aggregate) can enhance this immune response and, due to the patient safety risk the FDA regulates the amount of particles that can be present. There are always some number of particles in each injected sample, and although their presence can be detected, they don’t know what the particles actually are. A QC tool that can identify the particles would help manufactures trace them back to their source (e.g. a bad lot of syringes) and eliminate them. Partelligence aims to make particle identification routine in biopharma QC. The technology builds off our current instrument, Horizon, which was launched in mid-2017 and already sold to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The technique works by analyzing several combinatorial features including size, morphology, optical contrast, and intrinsic fluorescence, and in this proposal we will test which features are key to enable the most accurate and rapid particle recognition. To date, we have performed feasibility experiments validating our ability to identify a few commonly found particles in biopharma solutions. Given this, our goals in Phase I are to expand on these studies by building a comprehensive training set and by testing a number of different algorithms. We will first start with reference samples, and then move to real biopharmaceutical samples provided by our pharma collaborators. At the end of the study, we will do a feasibility analysis to determine if the throughput, specificity and reliability meets the needs of the industry. Narrative We propose to evaluate a particle recognition technique to enable accurate and rapid identification of unwanted contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Successful development of this analytical technique would improve bioprocess control by identifying dangers early on in development and throughout the manufacturing process, resulting in safer protein drugs, reduced recalls and shortened time to market.",Partelligence,9679781,R43GM132995,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Alpha Particles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fluorescence', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Rubber', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Syringes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'bioprocess', 'combinatorial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'forest', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'instrument', 'manufacturing process', 'microscopic imaging', 'particle', 'patient response', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'protein aggregate', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"OPTOFLUIDICS, INC.",R43,2018,203830,-0.03555064537712967
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9530534,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,198750,0.015111362487662792
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9521026,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Supervision', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,253287,0.017733683985990234
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9609312,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'immunomodulatory drugs', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,69586,-0.01676541647389541
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9464147,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,1524997,0.02551511452016338
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9457491,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,863172,-0.005090745734208583
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9427961,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2018,185224,0.024143798892841566
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9465735,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2018,178854,-0.017694662165346948
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9444928,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,229500,0.01572471776043756
"Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018 Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare inherited neurocutaneous disease characterized by ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or tetraplegia, intellectual disability, and a distinctive retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in ALDH3A2, which codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. Despite knowing the gene defect and enzyme abnormality, the pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear and no single biomarker exists that correlates with disease severity. FALDH deficiency results in several lipid abnormalities including accumulation of fatty aldehydes, which have potential toxic effects via formation of covalent adducts with proteins and lipids. This unusual lipid abnormality has the potential to affect multiple unrelated cellular pathways that are critical for disease pathogenesis. Our recent metabolomic studies in SLS have identified a unique biochemical profile of at least 30 metabolites in plasma that suggests disruption of several previously unsuspected pathways. We now propose to mine our STAIR 7004 clinical database of 20 SLS patients together with their associated metabolomic data to develop a minimal “metabolomic profile” that will correlate with severity of clinical symptoms and function as a reliable biomarker. These studies will utilize various statistical analytical methods, including principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and random forest analysis, to define a minimal group of clinically informative metabolites, representing multiple biochemical pathways, for construction of a SLS metabolomic profile. When completed, this research will provide an objective biomarker for SLS disease description and therapeutic monitoring. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spasticity, intellectual disability and a distinct retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in a gene called ALDH3A2 and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. The pathogenic mechanisms that are responsible for the symptoms are still not defined. The proposed research will investigate whether a distinctly abnormal group of biochemicals in the blood, which constitute a “metabolomics profile”, will correlate with the severity of symptoms in patients and thereby act as an objective biomarker for disease severity.",Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018,9719054,U54HD061939,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital ichthyosis', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty Acids', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Lipids', 'Little&apos', 's Disease', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Neurocutaneous Syndromes', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Specimen', 'Sterols', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'adduct', 'analytical method', 'biomarker identification', 'fatty aldehyde', 'forest', 'isoprenoid', 'lipid metabolism', 'long-chain-aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'response', 'spasticity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2018,58479,0.0015659526368503362
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9446030,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,627529,0.006584514185454508
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9463650,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2018,460833,0.015745066902504337

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9355693,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,406785,0.015255697751826846
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'learning network', 'men', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,-0.0040528877432331675
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9312083,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,395858,0.027939185802519036
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,0.0035264032799750436
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,0.006207814182149855
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9221662,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,377226,0.001048222876054296
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9216965,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,388615,-0.006851419886745424
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9345356,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylase', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Supervision', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'desensitization', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,38039,-0.05082956831224014
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9275314,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2017,142177,-0.009610047835143718
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9310591,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,607934,-0.004482488329286616
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9357736,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filoviridae', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Products', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'clinical candidate', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2017,312390,0.0010250059232806594
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9238793,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2017,166104,-0.005402820617375663
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,0.015111362487662792
"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9355704,UG3OD023281,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Ecology', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant formula', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poverty', 'Premature Infant', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'course development', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'health disparity', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'neonatal care', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient population', 'premature', 'professor', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2017,1679656,0.010266987555933943
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9308943,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Genetic', 'Glycosides', 'IGA Glomerulonephritis', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'exhaustion', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,200347,-0.00807008603161484
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments.

"Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining Project summary  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that is based on the application of a weak, high frequency electrical current to a muscle and the measurement of the resulting surface voltages. The further development and application of EIM remains the main business focus of Skulpt, Inc, a small business concern based in Boston and San Francisco (Specific Aims just say San Francisco). Alterations to the condition of the muscle, including myocyte atrophy, fat and connective tissue deposition, and inflammation all alter the EIM data in predictable and consistent ways. To date, through Skulpt, EIM has been applied as a potential biomarker for assessing disease progression and response to therapy in a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as other disorders that impact muscle condition, such as disuse atrophy and sarcopenia (age related muscle loss); over 1000 people have been studied with Skulpt’s EIM technology. Whereas the results of these applications are promising, the analytic approaches taken to the data sets have been fairly basic, utilizing only simple single frequency or simplistic multifrequency values. However, with every single muscle measurement, over 240 individual data points are acquired at different frequencies, different depths of muscle penetration, and at different angles to the major muscle fiber direction. Moreover, each of the above studies has been done in isolation, and thus how results differ between diseases is unknown. Given the plethora of data, applying more sophisticated analytic approaches has the potential of yielding improved EIM measures. Moreover, collaborators have already collected an associated wealth of animal EIM data that will help further inform this analysis. Thus, in this proposed Phase 1 SBIR, we plan to apply a variety of data mining techniques to the vast set of data already accumulated at Skulpt, Inc such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed and implemented. In Specific Aim 1, we will study human data across all disease types evaluated to determine which data sets are most effective at discriminating diseased from healthy muscle as well as distinguishing between diseases. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on finding the metrics that are most sensitive to the degree of muscle pathology in a specific disease. In both of these aims, we will evaluate how these new metrics are mirrored in already obtained animal data. In Specific Aim 3, we will study these metrics in a new set of data (a test set) that was not used to develop the analytical paradigms so as to ensure their robustness. With the conclusion of this work, we will plan to pursue a Phase 2 SBIR that will focus on the development of a software suite to assist in EIM data interpretation based upon these results followed by a prospective observational clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of these newly developed metrics for disease diagnosis and tracking of progression/response to therapy. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that remains the main focus of Skulpt, Inc. Considerable EIM data has already been collected in a variety of neuromuscular diseases. In this study, the investigators plan to perform a more detailed analysis of all data collected to date (so-called “data mining”), such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed that will be applied to future studies.",Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining,9466075,R43AR073114,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease remission', 'Disuse Atrophy', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glycogen storage disease type II', 'Health', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neuromuscular', 'potential biomarker', 'prospective', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'voltage']",NIAMS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R43,2017,149998,-0.0004463863694028473
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9264015,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,877276,-0.005090745734208583
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9248094,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9338285,R01HL115336,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anatomy', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,557344,-0.016304158300996505
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,9210027,R01AA018886,"['ATF6 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,247500,-0.011209810826290573
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9314691,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2017,185224,0.024143798892841566
"Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a 5 year training program with the long-term goal of the candidate developing into an independent academic investigator with a research focus in hypertension in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease. The candidate will build on a background in clinical research developed during a comprehensive research fellowship spent studying ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The career development objectives are to obtain skills in designing and conducting prospective clinical research studies, learn statistical models to analyze ambulatory blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, gain experience in measuring and interpreting cardiovascular physiologic parameters including extracellular water and vascular resistance utilizing bioimpedance analysis, and participate in scholarly activities to facilitate te transition into an independent investigator. These will be applied immediately to investigating how extracellular volume and mediators of vascular resistance affect ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 1 will use a case control design to compare differences in extracellular water in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 2 will determine how extracellular volume, vasoconstrictor mediators of vascular resistance, and vascular resistance itself modify ambulatory blood pressure and the ambulatory blood pressure slope in these two groups. In aim 3, the candidate will gain experience in designing and conducting a randomized trial by comparing the effects of carvedilol vs. prazosin on ambulatory blood pressure, vascular resistance, and mediators of vascular resistance in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The candidate will develop these skills with the support a primary mentor, 3 co-mentors (including one translational research cardiologist and one biostatistician), and a research advisory committee with extensive experience in multiple research disciplines. The candidate and his advisors are located at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a leading academic medical center with substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. The candidate will take advantage of numerous courses and research activities as a Clinical Research Scholar in the Department of Clinical Sciences that will promote the overall development of his career. Consistent with the candidate's long term career goals, the findings from this study can be broadened to studying hypertension in hemodialysis patients in general. Understanding the relationship between extracellular volume, vascular resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure will provide the opportunity to investigate how pharmacologic therapies affect each component and how this can improve cardiovascular outcomes in hemodialysis patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In hemodialysis patients, high blood pressure increases the risk for death and complications related to heart disease. This research studies how hemodynamic changes during dialysis are associated with high blood pressure measured throughout the entire 44 hour period between dialysis treatments. Findings from this project will direct future studies that investigate which medications or interventions will most successfully lower blood pressure and reduce adverse events in hemodialysis patients.",Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension,9303381,K23DK096007,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Angiotensin II', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Water', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Discipline', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impedance Cardiography', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prazosin', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrafiltration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular resistance', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Water', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'career development', 'carvedilol', 'case control', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trial comparing', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDDK,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2017,159840,-0.006555831767963703
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,180249,-0.005045871918180692
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kynurenine catabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation in humans produces metabolites that are neurologically active and affect neurotransmission and neuronal integrity. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a product of the pathway which has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and has been correlated with depression in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-α. Besides, activation of the kynurenine pathway by inflammation leads to elevated levels of QUIN, which have been shown to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. The mechanism by which QUIN acts in the brain is to activate excitotoxic neurotransmitter pathways involving the amino acid glutamate and by leading to lipid peroxidation. Following metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent steps, three consecutive enzymes of the kynurenine pathway determine the metabolic partitioning of tryptophan metabolites to QUIN, picolinic acid (PIC), or further metabolism. We hypothesize that the shift of QUIN and PIC levels is linked to chronic inflammation and major depression. To test this hypothesis, we will, in the first aim, study the structure and action of the enzymes and the mechanisms controlling QUIN and PIC production. In the second aim, a new, rapid and efficient analytical method will be developed for in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of QUIN and PIC levels and will be applied to samples obtained from patient populations expected to exhibit high levels of QUIN as a result of increased inflammation and from assays using purified protein to simulate similar distributions. Through these studies, the correlation between kynurenine metabolites and major depression will be investigated, and small molecule inhibitors will be used as probes for modulating the production of QUIN and PIC levels. n/a",Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study,9272010,R21MH107985,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Carboxy-Lyases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Epilepsy', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Kynurenic Acid', 'Kynurenine', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picolinic Acids', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quinolinic Acid', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan 2,3 Dioxygenase', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'enzyme pathway', 'excitotoxicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'patient population', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2017,222688,-0.001233214331567489
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9323657,U01AI131344,"['Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2017,490338,0.015745066902504337
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,0.0035264032799750436
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,0.006207814182149855
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit.

"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,-0.01215223250984086
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9195237,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,37571,-0.05082956831224014
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9094553,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2016,141588,-0.009610047835143718
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9204673,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Product Drug', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'bioactive natural products', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2016,288801,0.0010250059232806594
"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series. We will further leverage the exceptional facilities at Rutgers to ultimately lead to a clinical candidate by the end of phas II.",Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy,9045992,R41AI122434,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Colony-forming units', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diamines', 'Disease', 'Disease Reservoirs', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Extreme drug resistant tuberculosis', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nitrofurans', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphate Buffer', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Saline', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'South Africa', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triazines', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'absorption', 'analog', 'aqueous', 'base', 'carbene', 'cytotoxicity', 'diphenyl', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'extensive drug resistance', 'genome sequencing', 'global health', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'killings', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'whole genome']",NIAID,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2016,149388,-0.014614434979951494
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9024612,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2016,166104,-0.005402820617375663
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.            ",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9128230,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Glycosides', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,251130,-0.00807008603161484
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.0032094623933205256
"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9262661,UG3OD023281,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Ecology', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Encephalitis', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Premature Infant', 'Qualifying', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'course development', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'health disparity', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'neonatal care', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient population', 'premature', 'professor', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2016,1661003,0.010266987555933943
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies.

"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.        ","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9083622,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'meetings', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'older women', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,848973,-0.005090745734208583
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,-0.008679252275192733
"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,9267858,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2016,227250,0.040384101305000315
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9116282,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,553894,-0.016304158300996505
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3.

"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9168282,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2016,217444,-0.005045871918180692
"Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kynurenine catabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation in humans produces metabolites that are neurologically active and affect neurotransmission and neuronal integrity. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a product of the pathway which has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and has been correlated with depression in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-α. Besides, activation of the kynurenine pathway by inflammation leads to elevated levels of QUIN, which have been shown to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. The mechanism by which QUIN acts in the brain is to activate excitotoxic neurotransmitter pathways involving the amino acid glutamate and by leading to lipid peroxidation. Following metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent steps, three consecutive enzymes of the kynurenine pathway determine the metabolic partitioning of tryptophan metabolites to QUIN, picolinic acid (PIC), or further metabolism. We hypothesize that the shift of QUIN and PIC levels is linked to chronic inflammation and major depression. To test this hypothesis, we will, in the first aim, study the structure and action of the enzymes and the mechanisms controlling QUIN and PIC production. In the second aim, a new, rapid and efficient analytical method will be developed for in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of QUIN and PIC levels and will be applied to samples obtained from patient populations expected to exhibit high levels of QUIN as a result of increased inflammation and from assays using purified protein to simulate similar distributions. Through these studies, the correlation between kynurenine metabolites and major depression will be investigated, and small molecule inhibitors will be used as probes for modulating the production of QUIN and PIC levels.         n/a",Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study,9112097,R21MH107985,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Carboxy-Lyases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzymes', 'Epilepsy', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Kynurenic Acid', 'Kynurenine', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picolinic Acids', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quinolinic Acid', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan 2,3 Dioxygenase', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'enzyme pathway', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'patient population', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2016,197688,-0.001233214331567489
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,9020203,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,181875,0.014276270980362573

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,0.0035264032799750436
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,-0.011833370881269413
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.            ",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,8947064,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2015,142069,-0.009610047835143718
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.            ",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,8860899,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2015,132192,-0.005402820617375663
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,0.0032094623933205256
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8896855,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,542263,-0.016304158300996505
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades.

"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.            ",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,8992226,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.040384101305000315
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale. Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.            ",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,8881522,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,236125,0.014276270980362573
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,0.0035264032799750436
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,-0.008679252275192733
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8724239,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,341074,-0.016304158300996505
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,0.0035264032799750436
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.            ",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8580503,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,469362,-0.016304158300996505
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.            ",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,8438156,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,373745,-0.011209810826290573
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised. Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model. Towards this, we have assembled a highly diverse and collaborative team including microbiologists, aerobiologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians/statisticians, veterinarians, veterinary pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.",Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates,8528702,R01HL106790,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'CCL24 gene', 'CCL25 gene', 'CCL27 gene', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Focus Groups', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Granuloma', 'Granulomatous', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Lung', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vaccines', 'Veterinarians', 'base', 'chemokine', 'combat', 'empowered', 'genome-wide', 'immunopathology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'latent infection', 'nanoparticle', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'pulmonary granuloma', 'reactivation from latency', 'receptor', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis granuloma']",NHLBI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2013,696467,0.030853216833089076
"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the Hispanic population is growing significantly which is of great concern. In Hispanics, the viral infection progresses more rapidly when compared with Caucasian patients and the treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Disturbingly, current treatments seem to be less effective on Hispanics. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabolomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from patients. We will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create our first order biomarker panels. In phase two, we will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). Dr. Spratt's research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve our SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer vs non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs. n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8308938,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2012,133197,-0.018477731792245492
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Molecular Genetic Investigation of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by varying degrees of cytopenias, and ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. MDS can be classified as primary de novo MDS with no apparent underlying cause and secondary MDS following congenital or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders or cytotoxic therapies. Little is known about initiating events leading to pediatric MDS. As a result, no targeted therapies exist and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic option.  The heterogeneous clinical and laboratory presentation and limited availability of clinically well-annotated patient samples and in vivo models have posed significant obstacles to study the disease and to identify genetic alterations unique to pediatric MDS. Therefore pediatric MDS remains largely classified by morphologic and cytogenetic criteria that provide few clues as to the molecular basis. Over the last 18 months, we have developed the first nationwide comprehensive Pediatric MDS and BMF Disorder Patient Registry and Tissue Repository now involving 3 institutions and continuing to grow. The registry has collected samples from > 60 individual patients in addition to biological material from 3 unique kindreds with pediatric MDS. These samples form the basis for our first genomic sequencing analysis to gather preliminary data for future experiments and represent the power of this registry to elucidate pathogenic mutations associated with MDS.  Our unique team of investigators will exploit the registry and catalyze our efforts to determine the fundamental underpinnings of pediatric MDS. The team includes David Williams (clinical/translational hematology), Mark Fleming (pediatric hematopathology /hematological genetics), Benjamin Ebert (high throughput genomic technologies in adult MDS) and Kyriacos Markinanos (genetic linkage analysis). We will undertake preliminary studies to demonstrate feasibility, and generate genomic data that will provide the basis for future hypothesis-driven translational and clinical research studies on a national level.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood. By exploiting several well-characterized families with inherited MDS, we will aim to identify the genetic basis for this disorder.  Results obtained not only promise to provide critical insights into the biology of pediatric patients, but will likely increase knowledg into the genetics of adult MDS.              The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,0.027127097154720167
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8134899,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2011,134067,-0.018063174400364923
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8077374,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,105194,0.027127097154720167
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.  Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation.     Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB.

Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  but  silence  over  the  course  of  several  weeks.  This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.  Towards  this,  we  have  assembled  a  highly  diverse  and  collaborative  team  including  microbiologists,  aerobiologists,  bioinformaticians,  mathematicians/statisticians,  veterinarians,  veterinary  pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.              Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs).

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7907646,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2010,131421,-0.018063174400364923
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.              Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs).

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7675425,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2009,128852,-0.018063174400364923

"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to NOT-OD-09-058 NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications. Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Our currently funded R03 grant, ""Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,"" consists of the following three specific aims (SA.1) extend the recursive partitioning and random forest classification methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment including implementing our ordinal impurity criteria in rpart and implementing the ordinal impurity criteria in randomForest; (SA.2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods in comparison to existing nominal and continuous response methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; and (SA.3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been described. Herein we propose to extend the L1 penalized method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing a model-based ordinal classification methodology applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies considered in the parent grant. The specific aims of this competitive revision application are to: Aim 1) Extend the L1 penalized methodology to enable predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; Aim 2) Using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets, evaluate L1 penalized ordinal response models by comparing error rates from our L1 fitting algorithm to those obtained when using a forward variable selection modeling strategy and our ordinal random forest approach; and Aim 3) Evaluate methods for assessing important covariates from L1 penalized ordinal response models.           This project will develop L1 penalized ordinal response models and implement them in the R programming environment. By conducting extensive comparisons of various ordinal response modeling methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets, we will be able to make a recommendation regarding ordinal response modeling to the scientific community. This research is significant since the ordinal response modeling methods developed during the project period will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7805045,R03LM009347,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioconductor', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Drug toxicity', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'In complete remission', 'Informatics', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'liver biopsy', 'meetings', 'neglect', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'partial response', 'preference', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'social', 'software development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,75000,-0.019050796726475264
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7648231,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2009,221910,-0.014568525165587454
"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.              Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs).

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,-0.05149919744669341
"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7386231,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2008,126357,-0.018063174400364923
"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere.

"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7434510,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,181300,0.00030980264290113974

While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7509654,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2008,188750,-0.014568525165587454
"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7265522,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,77600,-0.05149919744669341
"Systems analysis of oxygen regulation in Halobacterium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To withstand environmental onslaught, biological systems mount global programs to coordinate the induction of protection and repair mechanisms. This proposal poses the hypothesis that the transcriptional networks underlying such responses to diverse stressors are interrelated. Halobacterium, a halophilic archaeon, has been chosen as a model for this study because it routinely negotiates an array of adverse conditions in its extreme environment, including anoxia, metal stress, and radiation damage. This proposal will investigate the inter-relationship of these responses using global approaches. Given that basal genetic information processing pathways in Halobacterium are mediated by eukaryotic-like proteins, findings from this study will have a direct impact on understanding how complex eukaryotic organisms elicit orthogonal responses in disease-perturbed or infection states. Specifically, I will (1) Characterize key transcriptional regulators responsible for mediating responses to fluctuating oxygen concentrations and identify regulons under their direct and indirect control; (2) Through statistical analysis of integrated datasets, evaluate the extent of cross-regulation of the anoxic response with other environmental perturbations; (3) Experimentally test new hypotheses generated by statistical analysis. These proposed experiments are expected to result in a transcriptional network model that addresses how organisms maintain homeostasis despite stress.           n/a",Systems analysis of oxygen regulation in Halobacterium,7261251,F32GM078980,"['Address', 'Aerobic', 'Algorithms', 'Anoxia', 'Archaea', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Halobacterium', 'Homeostasis', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Information Systems', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Localized', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Metals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutate', 'Names', 'Organism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen measurement, partial pressure, arterial', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulon', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Study models', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell injury', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'halobacteria', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metal poisoning', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'stressor', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,F32,2007,48796,-0.007787405805779672
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7197734,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,222000,0.00030980264290113974
"Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brucellosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease that affects humans and a variety of farm animals. As well as a threat to public health it has considerable economic importance. The etiologic agent responsible for human infection, Brucella melitensis, is classified by both NIAID and CDC as a Category B biothreat pathogen. Antibiotics are only partially effective at controlling the disease and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key to containing infection. Currently, the most common diagnostic tests for Brucella are based on indirect serology which are lacking in specificity and sensitivity as well as speed of execution. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved diagnostics, especially technologies that may be used at field level. This investigation proposes to address this issue and develop a superior and robust technique for diagnosing Brucella infection with highly specific, non-cross reactive antibody reactions. We will achieve this goal by screening the Brucella genome using novel proteomic chip technology to identify unique antigens that will yield highly specific and accurate diagnoses. This work will be undertaken in Phase 1 of the application. In Phase 2, when antigens have been selected, we anticipate that we will proceed to develop ELISA and immunoblot assays. In parallel, both ELISA and lateral flow ""dipstick"" tests for Brucella antigen will be constructed. We envisage that the antigen assays will have particular utility in detecting Brucella disseminated in the context of the bioterrorism event. The diagnostic tools developed within this application will be rigorously evaluated for sensitivity and specificity using large and diverse panels of human and animal Brucella-positive sera available through our collaborators. The project proposes to develop a highly sensitive and robust diagnostic test for brucellosis, also known as ""undulant fever"", an infectious disease that causes serious illness in farm animals and humans. The current techniques for diagnosing infection are somewhat unreliable and based on outmoded methods. This investigation will use state- of-the-art technology to identify new structures or antigens on Brucella bacteria that may be used to develop a test with superior diagnostic performance.          n/a",Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species,7278655,R43AI068166,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Bioterrorism', 'Brucella', 'Brucella abortus', 'Brucella melitensis', 'Brucellosis', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunodominant Antigens', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Livestock', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Printing', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'Yersinia enterocolitica', 'base', 'biothreat', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,"INBIOS INTERNATIONAL, INC.",R43,2007,278818,0.017594104735280926
"Nosocomial infections: Automated typing and data mining   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nosocomial infections cause about 90,000        deaths annually in the U.S. and have an associated medical care cost of about        3.5 billion dollars. Despite being the fourth leading cause of death, there has      been limited development of rapid, integrated tools for determination of             outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections. The goal of the proposed research is      to test feasibility of development of software algorithms for identifying            clusters of bacteria involved in nosocomial infections. This will be                 accomplished by creation of new algorithms for clustering bacterial fatty acid       composition data to detect infection clusters and through the creation of a          ""data mining"" algorithm to provide patient demographic information needed to         distinguish nosocomial outbreaks from community-acquired infections or               pseudo-outbreaks.

"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity. GAT will particularly benefit researchers working in preclinical stages of drug development who require rapid, sensitive, and reliable results to inform decisions about which targets to advance to clinical trial testing.",Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies,10011686,R43AI152894,"['Adoption', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HIV', 'HIV/HCV', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Infection Control', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Serological', 'Serotyping', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'base', 'chronic infection', 'co-infection', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'neural network', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'structural genomics', 'syntax', 'tool', 'viral resistance']",NIAID,"GATACA, LLC",R43,2020,267225,-0.01164525179192464
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9938424,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,710049,-0.015735629832477893
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,0.012741272862049199
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,10015315,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,312939,0.01851084867444586
"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia. Using artificial intelligence to quantitatively describe the changes over time in normal placentas and those with disease could help understand preterm birth and diseases of pregnancy.",Developing a virtual placenta biobank,10040733,K08EB030120,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellularity', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decidual Cell', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elements', 'Endocrine system', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Feeds', 'Fetal Lung', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemosiderosis', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Radar', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Villous', 'Villus', 'Yang', 'algorithm training', 'biobank', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chorionic plate', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'fetal', 'health of the mother', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'online repository', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'professor', 'supplemental instruction', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'virtual', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,185630,-0.0386419444389337
"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10028766,R35GM138353,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Foundations', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteome', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genome analysis', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'response']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,382710,0.010263593219169777
"THE SEARCH FOR COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CURE: ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNATE/ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY INTEGRATING NOVEL INFORMATICS, TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH Individual CTSA hubs are leading the national clinical and translational research efforts in developing new approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This crucial role was natural. Long before the current crisis, CTSA hubs were committed to translation, building multidisciplinary teams of investigators and community partners, overcoming regulatory burdens, ensuring quality in clinical and human research, developing transformative informatics, and disruptive technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this proposal, we build on our center’s active participation in meaningful clinical trials (e.g., the NIH Remdesivir RCT), the early creation of a biospecimen repository from COVID-19 patients, institutional commitment and fundraising that led to a $3.5 million pilot fund distribution, a robust and accessible clinical database repository, and the ongoing work of an NCATS-supported CTSA Collaboration Innovation Award (a coalition of the J. Craig Venter Institute, UCSD, UCI, and Stanford) focused on artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Using the emerging informatics framework of supervised generalized canonical correlation for integrative data analysis, we will link clinical data from COVID-19 patients enrolled in a variety of trials and at various stages of disease with innovative in vitro evaluation of innate and adaptive immunity, an area still poorly understood in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, obtained from patient biospecimens to obtain mechanistic insights of COVID-19 pathogenesis at a systems level. Innate and adaptive immunity are particularly relevant to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis because they play key, but distinct, roles at all phases of the illness (initial tissue-virus interaction; systemic responses; the cell-mediated cytokine storm leading to multi- organ failure and death, likely long after levels of viremia have fallen; and, ultimately, protective immunity). The current CCIA novel flow cytometry informatics research permits elucidation of dynamic cellular immune responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were heretofore unobservable. Using Hi-DAFi for mass cytometry analysis, validated informatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomics analysis, and cutting-edge statistical data integration and machine learning strategies tied back to the available clinical data we will be able to discover novel associations between cellular biomarkers and disease state, a particular therapy, and disease mediating factors such as age, health disparities, and the presence of other diseases or conditions like obesity. This information will aid in critical efforts to target new therapies and possibly identify idiosyncratic individual physiologic variables that render certain patients who seem to have no known comorbidities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, the robust connection between the UCI hub and both regional and national networks (e.g., BRAID, the coalition of the 5 UC CTSAs, and NCATS Trial Innovation Network) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly disseminate clinically relevant discoveries and engage the talent and insight of the many clinicians and scientists working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9851830,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2020,110387,0.007515886636850863
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,9953139,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'protein profiling', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.01713297812190451
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10013198,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2020,187049,-0.006294954100307973
"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112402,-0.006160270794236425
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,-0.07782214991783414
"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,9889390,R21AR074685,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Arthritis', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee Injuries', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'joint destruction', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,200007,-0.013842741896093079
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features.

"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort. The successful outcome of this study will aid physicians in identifying patients for targeted therapies.",Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM,9865565,R01HL150023,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'regional difference', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,700225,-0.028413358598534916
"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN. Our findings will reveal potential clinical biomarkers of HTN and inform the development of microbiome-based therapeutic strategies against the development of HTN.",Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension.,9990103,F31HL152495,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Choice', 'Cause of Death', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'Dahl Hypertensive Rats', 'Data', 'Desulfovibrio', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Sulfide', 'Hypertension', 'Immunology', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Intake', 'Laboratories', 'Lactobacillus helveticus', 'Latina', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patients', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Research', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Shotguns', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Supplementation', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alternative treatment', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical biomarkers', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hypertension treatment', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'modifiable risk', 'mutant', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prolyl-proline', 'prolylisoleucine', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'salt sensitive', 'salt sensitive hypertension', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'sulfate reducing bacteria', 'tool', 'urinary']",NHLBI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,F31,2020,45520,0.023730179282421656
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,-0.007586556846385558
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,9979523,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77243,-0.029233053078144434
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States.

"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection,9974479,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,87707,0.023971183552253153
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus on dried blood spot samples.",NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume,10050866,R01HD099250,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital herpes simplex', 'Consumption', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simplexvirus', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital cytomegalovirus', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'next generation sequencing', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'screening program', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral detection']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,671761,0.02469577440499714
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10050030,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,535171,-0.012276032920556599
"CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement Abstract  This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-20-032. This is a supplement to U54 CA242646, “California-Mexico-Puerto Rico Partnership (CAMPO) Center for Prevention of HPV-related Cancer in HIV+ Populations”. The parent grant's focus is to perform research on reducing the risk of cervical and anal cancer in men and women living with HIV in Latin America. CAMPO Study 1 will enroll 4000 women and 1000 men living with HIV to optimize screening algorithms to detect cervical and anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The incidence of anal cancer is high among all groups of Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among those in Puerto Rico (PR). HPV infection is necessary but insufficient for the development of anal HSIL and cancer. The goal of this supplement is to elucidate the role of the anal microbiome as a contributor to this increased risk of anal cancer risk in these high-risk populations. Specific aims are 1) Study the relationship between anal high- risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and PR; and 2) Study the relationship between anal HSIL and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV infection. These populations are of particular interest given their divergent lifestyles but similarity in genetic background. We hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH without anal HSIL, the microbiome will be different among those with and without hr-HPV infection. We hypothesize that the proportion with pro-inflammatory-mediating taxa will be highest among the PR population compared with the Mexican and California populations given the higher incidence in anal cancer in PR. We also hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV at the 3 locations, detection of HSIL will be associated with a pro-inflammatory microbiome and a decrease in butyrate-producing signatures, with the proportion with pro-inflammatory changes highest in PR compared with the other populations.  We will enroll 100 PLWH (50 men and 50 women) at each of the PR, Mexico City and San Francisco CAMPO sites, for a total of 300 Hispanic PLWH. Data on anal HPV, anal cytology and anal HSIL will be available through CAMPO Study 1 in PR and Mexico City, and from the San Francisco ANCRE Clinic, where PLWH are screened for anal HSIL as part of routine clinical care. A validated food frequency questionnaire in Spanish will be administered to assess dietary intake for the previous 3 and 6 months. Anal swab specimens will be retrieved from the CAMPO Biorepository and used for microbiome analysis. The 16S gene will be amplified from extracted anal swab genomic DNA and subjected to Illumina Miseq. Sequences of the 16S gene V4 region will be analyzed in QIIME2. Random forest classification will be performed to understand how our predictors, i.e. microbiome variables (diversity measurements, species-level taxa) and other covariates (sociodemographics, sex, diet, clinical data, etc.), are associated with hr-HPV infection or HSIL (outcomes). Narrative As the incidence of anal cancer is high in Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially in Puerto Rico, this supplement aims to study the relationship between anal high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and Puerto Rico (PR). Building on the parent U54 California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium infrastructure, we will enroll 300 Hispanic PLWH from the study sites, collect anal swabs for anal HPV testing, cytology and microbiome analysis, perform high resolution anoscopy and collect data to assess dietary intake. The anal microbiota profiles will be analyzed among the three Hispanic populations and will shed light on the role of the anal microbiome in potentiating anal HPV-related anal disease in these high- risk populations.",CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement,10166395,U54CA242646,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Biopsy', 'Butyrates', 'California', 'Cervical', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Latin America', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncoproteins', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Puerto Rico', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'Swab', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'biobank', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cervical and anal cancer', 'clinical care', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'interest', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'microbiota profiles', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'therapeutic vaccine']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2020,194934,-0.06025197280233146
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,0.01881416669567031
"Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes ABSTRACT As the rapidly unfolding COVID-19 pandemic claims its victims around the world, it has also inspired the scientific community to come up with solutions to meet an urgent and unmet need —i.e., ameliorate the severity of Covid- 19 and reduce mortality. Two obstacles make that task difficult—First, the pathophysiology of Covid-19 remains a mystery; the emerging reports generally agree that the disease has a very slow onset and that those who succumb typically mount a ‘cytokine storm’, i.e., an overzealous immune response. However, despite being implicated as a culprit behind the observed mortality and morbidity in COVID-19, we know virtually nothing about what constitutes (nature, extent) or contributes to (cell or origin) such an overzealous response. A significant number of patients have GI symptoms. The treatment goals in COVID-19 have been formulated largely as a ‘trial and error’-approach; this is reflected in the mixed results of the trials that have concluded. Second, the process of drug discovery is comprised of time-consuming steps; to avoid delays, we need to define the nature of the fatal cellular response before deciding how to model it in animals or matching therapeutics to curb it.  Our preliminary work has helped us define the aberrant host cellular response in COVID-19. We used machine learning tools that can look beyond interindividual variability to extract underlying gene expression patterns within complex data across multiple cohorts of viral pandemics, including COVID-19. The resultant pattern, i.e., signature, was subsequently exploited as a predictive model to navigate COVID-19 for GI symptoms. Surprisingly, the 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, inspiring the nomenclature-- (ViP)-signature. The ViP signature identified and predicted the disease severity of SARS-CoV2-infected patients. We hypothesized that the ViP signature provides a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the cellular response in viral pandemics and could serve as a powerful unbiased tool in our armamentarium to vet candidate drugs rapidly. In this proposal, our predicted model, experimental datasets and the information from published literature will be used to screen drugs/nutritional components/probiotics in the GI organoid derived monolayers in a semi-HTP format. We will experimentally validate the effect of the therapeutics predicted in ViP gene signature of the host. The following two aims will provide a translational impact on the COVID-19 emergency. Aim 1: Identify the gastro-intestinal pathogenic pathways during COVID-19. Aim 2: Determine the impact of drugs, nutrients and supplements in gut-in-a-dish model of COVID-19. Impact: This proposal will identify the gastro-intestinal pathways (in healthy and patients with chronic diseases) involved in the GI symptoms of COVID 19 and provide new treatment options in COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to rapidly claim lives and challenge the limits of our knowledge and our healthcare system. Other than “cytokine storm,” a significant amount of the patient shows gastrointestinal symptoms and nothing is known for the cellular pathways and any relevant treatment of COVID-19. The published literature, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided approaches, and our experimental datasets with GI- organoid-based cell models are used to identify host gastrointestinal pathways that can be targeted using drug/pro-prebiotics and nutritional supplements to combat the disease.",Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes,10177672,R01DK107585,"['2019-nCoV', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'China', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Duodenum', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enteral', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Esophagus', 'Feces', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'IL8 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Lower Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Nausea', 'Neutral Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Nomenclature', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prodrugs', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'Rectum', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Intestines', 'Specimen', 'Stomach', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'VIP gene', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'cohort', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'dietary supplements', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'genetic signature', 'gut microbiota', 'ileum', 'intestinal epithelium', 'microbial', 'monolayer', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'prebiotics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'transmission process', 'viral RNA', 'virtual']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,354469,-0.0024840789101871707
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease.

"Antibodies as Drugs ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Antibodies as Drugs organized by Drs. Pierre Bruhns, Patrick C. Wilson, Esther Breij and David P. Humphreys. The conference will be held in Whistler, British Columbia from January 27-30, 2021. Therapeutic antibodies continue to largely populate the list of top biologic drugs. They revolutionize the treatment of pathologies falling into major disease areas, which include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. As more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, there has also been a concomitant increase in the frequency of resistance and escape mechanisms. Thus, researchers are exploring alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, not only are new methodological and technological advances being developed, paradigm-shifting concepts are being developed in order to face these challenges. This conference in the Keystone Symposia series on Antibodies as Drugs aims to present the state-of-the-art in antibody therapeutics, repertoires and deep learning, bispecific antibodies and engineering. This conference will provide a forum for extensive interactions between investigators from both industry and academia. Goals of this conference include discussion of recent breakthroughs in identifying therapeutics from patients, understanding vaccination and mode of delivery, modalities for half-life extensions and involvement of complement in antibody mode of action. It is anticipated that research in the field will showcase the rise of bispecific antibodies and highlight the technologies to develop them, improve their functionalities, and boost clinical efficacies, particularly in immune-oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The success of early antibody approaches has been tremendous and now they have revolutionized treatment for many major disease areas, such as cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. However, as more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, then more resistance and escape mechanisms are being found, forcing scientists to search for alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, this conference will gather scientists from many different disciplines, including structural and cellular immunology, biology, engineering, chemistry and medicine, to share ideas and help develop novel antibody therapeutics.",Antibodies as Drugs,10071067,R13AI154980,"['Academia', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bispecific Antibodies', 'British Columbia', 'Cellular Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Extension', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccination', 'antibody engineering', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'posters', 'prevent', 'resistance frequency', 'success', 'symposium']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2020,11500,-0.011723835562039467
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10080771,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing Alternatives', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Baculoviruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Economic Burden', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Ferrets', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Ha antigen', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Insecta', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recombinants', 'Seasons', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Serological', 'Severities', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Spanish flu', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Antigens', 'Switzerland', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Translations', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Antigens', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiviral immunity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'flu', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'infection rate', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'mutant', 'neutralizing antibody', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,"BIOLOGICAL MIMETICS, INC.",R43,2020,299218,0.020281582105320325
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9844413,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,352587,-0.006851419886745424
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,-0.008892300031268651
"Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations Project Summary The spleen plays a key role in the human immune system but also clears senescent red blood cells (RBC) from the circulation and those altered by acquired or inherited diseases. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is one of the first targets of pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. Under hypoxic conditions, mutated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes to fibers which increase both the stiffness and adhesion of RBC. Splenic filtration of altered RBC prone to sickling (a process that cannot be directly observed in human subjects) contributes to anemia and likely triggers acute splenic sequestration crises (ASSC). On the other hand, it potentially prevents complications associated with intravascular sickling. Self- amplified blockade of vessels with sickled RBCs is indeed a hallmark of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and acute hepatic crises, that severely impact the life quality and expectancy of patients with SCD. We propose to formulate and validate a new predictive modeling framework for how the spleen filters altered RBC in SCD by synergistically integrating in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data using multifidelity-based neural networks (NN). This will deliver predictive models that can continuously learn when new data become available, a paradigm shift in biomedical modeling. We will develop multiscale/multifidelity computational models (and corresponding NN implementations) that link sub-cellular, cellular, and vessel level phenomena spanning across four orders of magnitude in spatio-temporal scales. This scale coupling will be accomplished using a molecular dynamics/dissipative particle dynamics (MD/DPD) framework. We will validate these predictive computational models by data from in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and RBC quantitative features collected in SCD patients. Specifically, we will use three new spleen-on-a-chip microfluidic devices with oxygen control and the unique human spleen perfusion setup of our foreign partner, with the following aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a splenic inter-endothelial slit filtration model; Aim 2: Develop new models of RBC macrophage adhesion and of phagocytosis in the spleen; Aim 3: Perform Spleen-on-a-Chip experiments and validation; Aim 4: Validate the predictive framework based on RBC samples from patients. Realization of our four Specific Aims will significantly increase our understanding of the complex pathogenic and protective roles of the spleen in SCD. Feeding our new multifidelity neural networks with morphological and functional measures of RBC circulating in SCD patients will lead to models for residual spleen function in SCD, which should help predict the risk of acute splenic sequestration crises, and guide optimal timing for Stem Cell Transplantation or Gene Therapy. The new paradigm in using deep learning tools to integrate data from different sources will be applicable to modeling many other blood diseases. Project Narrative In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is the target of early pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. We will formulate and validate predictive multiscale models for red blood cell (RBC) filtration by the spleen based on new deep learning neural networks fed with data from simulations, experiments using new spleen-mimetic microfluidics, and RBC quantitative features from ex vivo perfusion of human spleens and from SCD patients. These models will be used to predict acute splenic sequestrations crises and guide treatment decisions in patients with SCD.","Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations",10052044,R01HL154150,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Adhesiveness', 'Adhesives', 'Anemia', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Endothelium', 'Erythrocytes', 'Expectancy', 'Fiber', 'Filtration', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hepatic', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hereditary Spherocytosis', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Paris, France', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phagocytosis', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Source', 'Spleen', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Surface', 'System', 'Training', 'Validation', 'acute chest syndrome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'ex vivo perfusion', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'learning progression', 'macrophage', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neural network', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'retention rate', 'senescence', 'sickling', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'vaso-occlusive crisis']",NHLBI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,705243,-0.0281310103278899
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9838229,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2020,474671,-0.017694662165346948
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'diverse data', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,-0.0040528877432331675
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.034415529858243

"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and non- neutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. Coupled to a novel systems-Fc-engineering approach, the COVID-19 CR3022 monoclonal antibody will be engineered to specifically define the Fc-effector functions that provide the greatest impact on limiting disease. Collectively, these studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines. This proposal seeks to define the humoral correlates and mechanisms of action against COVID-19 in mice, ferrets, and monkeys.",Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19,10126673,R37AI080289,"['Adenoviruses', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'COVID-19', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Complement Activation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ferrets', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neutrophil Infiltration', 'Passive Transfer of Immunity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'antibody engineering', 'immunoregulation', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prevent', 'protective efficacy', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R37,2020,391727,0.029573314726352683
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,10015205,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2020,885000,0.02216478763982616
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria.

"Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Infection and Illness The new coronavirus outbreak that begin in December 2019 has created a global public health emergency. This has led to an intense search to identify factors that contribute to the susceptibility and severity of illness. We recently developed an array to identify antibody-binding epitopes for rhinoviruses. Data from these arrays can be combined with information about viral protein structure to identify highly immunogenic regions for respiratory viruses. We propose to expand this array to include linear epitopes that represent the entire proteome of SARS- CoV-2 and all other common coronaviruses that infect humans (OC43, NL63, etc.). The study population will include children from the COAST, WISC and URECA birth cohort studies who are also participating in the HEROS SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study. As part of routine cohort activities, these children undergo serial sampling of blood and nasal secretions that we can analyze using the array to determine individual patterns of antiviral antibody epitope recognition. We hypothesize that the pattern and quantity of antibody specific for epitopes of common coronaviruses contributes to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. We propose three specific aims that will utilize sera obtained from children before and after HEROS-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, in specimens obtained pre-infection we will use the array to identify patterns of antibody epitope recognition to common childhood coronaviruses, assess cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and determine whether cross-reactivity is associated with protection against infection or illness. In the second aim, we will determine whether the diversity of antibody responses to common respiratory viruses is associated with a reduced risk of infection or illness. Finally, in the third aim we will describe antibody binding patterns before and after known COVID-19 cases to identify candidate regions that are immunogenic and neutralizing. To accomplish this aim, we will perform micro-neutralization assays (available in the BSL3 laboratory of Dr. Kristen Bernard, UW Madison) on convalescent sera or nasal secretions from children who developed symptomatic infection. This information will be analyzed together with pre- and post-infection array data using machine learning approaches to identify neutralizing epitopes. Identifying patterns of serologic responses that are cross- protective could help to identify susceptible individuals in the population and direct the design of vaccines to current and future viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE (from parent grant) The morbidity and cost to society from childhood viral respiratory illnesses (VRI) is staggering, and allergic respiratory disease is rampant. In the search for prevention for these common and high-burden diseases, perhaps the solutions are on the farm. Our main hypothesis is that microbes in farming environments promote immune development in early life, and thereby reduce the severity of VRI and protect against allergies. We will test this hypothesis by expanding studies in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC), a birth cohort in dairy farm country consisting of children and their families who were enrolled before birth and then monitored for farm exposures, development of the immune system, respiratory illnesses and allergies. We hope to identify farm-related exposures, including microbes, that promote healthy immune development, and ultimately, healthy children. Completion of these studies will lead to development of new strategies for raising children who get fewer respiratory illnesses and avoid developing respiratory allergies.",Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity,10170660,U19AI104317,"['2019-nCoV', 'Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Antibody Response', 'Asthma', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Epitope', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nose', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Rhinovirus', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Structural Proteins', 'Virus', 'Wisconsin', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'immunogenic', 'infection risk', 'new technology', 'novel coronavirus', 'parent grant', 'public health emergency', 'respiratory', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'study population', 'surveillance study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U19,2020,406048,-0.00853245950605403
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,9950635,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serological', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,-0.0029956852742364926
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,9995722,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,395738,-0.007661171946171876
"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics,10100014,R01AI155765,"['Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Biohazardous Substance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cobalamin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Drug resistance', 'ELF3 gene', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Iron', 'Isoniazid resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'immunological status', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,781859,-0.0012691847043010233
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9902363,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,340154,0.006584514185454508
"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,-0.04578724618213932
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9888409,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,319844,-0.016276961847612105
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome. The proposed research introduces the first molecular tools to precisely understand the functions of microbiome communities in our health and disease in order to then delineate therapeutic interventions for diseases mediated by the gut microbiota, thereby addressing NIH's public health mission.",Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities,10029354,R35GM138201,"['Address', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioreactors', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Encyclopedias', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'fundamental research', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo evaluation', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'molecular dynamics', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'quantum', 'real time monitoring', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted agent', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R35,2020,342713,0.027823938235643053
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serologic tests', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,0.03216040882613368
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,9995661,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,615104,-0.008909819591544021

We propose to identify alterations in the plasma metabolome of patients experiencing different levels of severity of COVID-19. Such changes should be pivotal in allowing the prediction of the severity of the patient COVID-19 symptoms and also provide mechanistic information about the disease and its progression. In addition to our expertise in metabolomics, we are able to carry out this project because we have access to samples from the Yale New Haven Hospital System via the IMPACT Biorepository. This repository stores human specimens related to emerging respiratory viral infections (with a particular focus on COVID-19) in order to support research on factors related to viral expression, transmission, disease severity, progression, and susceptibility. The directors of the biorepository are co-investigators in this supplement. As such, we are in unique position to perform this novel research because we have: (a) the infrastructure to conduct the metabolomic analyses and we have already developed the methodologies, (b) access to COVID-19 patient plasma samples stored at the IMPACT (Implementing medical and public health actions against coronavirus in Connecticut) Biorepository (and associated patient records), (c) assembled an extraordinary team that includes expertise in metabolomics, virology, pulmonary and infectious disease, and immunology. of this supplement current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is of major concern because (i) it is highly contagious, (ii) it a spectrum of adverse health consequences (collectively known as COVID-19) that range from mild symptoms (fever, chills, cough) to life-endangering pneumonia and SARS, and (iii) there is no effective or vaccine to prevent it. To date, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had devastating effects on public with an international mortality rate of 5.8% in infected individuals. As of June 6, 2020, the U.S. has cases and a mortality rate of 5.7%. Measures taken to stem the pandemic have paralyzed normal  activities and crippled national and international economies.

Such analyses will be pivotal in allowing the prediction of the COVID-19 severity and also provide mechanistic information about the disease and its progression.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10221329,R21AA028432,"['2019-nCoV', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Beds', 'Bilirubin', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Connecticut', 'Coronavirus', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Family', 'Female', 'Ferritin', 'Fever', 'Fever Chills', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outpatients', 'Paralysed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA Viruses', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Triage', 'Vaccines', 'Ventilator', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Respiratory Tract Infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'cytokine', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flu', 'liver function', 'male', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metabolomics resource', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'stem', 'transmission process', 'virology']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,150625,0.002794441389410101
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,-0.0007940575391486644
"Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients The objective of this proposal is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Louisiana has the 5th highest death rate per capita in the United States as of May 4th, 2020. Severe disease is seen in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. The New Orleans population is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are rampant. After infection, acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Mounting evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 have cytokine storm syndrome, which may exacerbate multiorgan injury and risk of fibrotic complications. Lack of effective ways to identify and attenuate severe COVID-19 progression persist due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for cytokine storm syndrome and increased risk in older patients. Therefore, there is a need to determine the critical cytokine profiles responsible for severe COVID-19 progression to develop effective treatments. Further, it is essential to find a way to stage disease trajectory(ies) to identify therapeutic targets with precision to attenuate disease progression and uncover preventive strategies. Towards this end, we seek to leverage a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage to predict severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis by considering key cytokine-cell interactions. We hypothesize that the model will accurately predict quantitative changes in suites of key cytokines and matrix accumulation with varying COVID-19 progression within 10% accuracy. To accomplish this, we have assembled an investigative team at Tulane University with key expertise in virology, clinical infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and predictive mathematical models of tissue remodeling. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will identify the critical cytokine markers linked to viral-induced lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis. This will be accomplished by leveraging machine learning to determine the biomarkers and molecular pathways characterizing progression of severe COVID-19 to focus model formulation. In Aim 2, we will predict the severity of COVID-19 in older patients. Model predictions will be compared to blood markers of COVID-19 disease in cohorts of older patients at different stages of disease progression. The model will be refined and informed by cytokine data to discern causal biological pathways and disease processes that can be tested and targeted. Our expected outcome is to have determined the critical cytokine interactions responsible for lung tissue damage and dictating pathways for varying disease trajectories in older patients. These results are expected to have an important impact as the proposed predictive model will open new avenues of research to rationally design pharmaceutical interventions for severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the study will provide a paradigm-shifting open-source tool to delineate target therapeutics, estimate their efficacy, and move towards development of patient-specific treatment plans for older individuals. Severe COVID-19 is seen in older individuals and those with underlying complications such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Lack of effective ways to identify and halt severe COVID-19 progression persists due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for increased risk and cytokine storm syndrome. Towards this end, in this proposal we will test our hypothesis that a mathematical model informed by key patient- specific suites of cytokines is capable of predicting patient trajectories, which will provide a strong evidence- based proof of concept for future efforts to rationally design interventions for severe COVID-19 patients.",Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients,10162283,P20GM103629,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Cell Communication', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibrosis', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Louisiana', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'extracellular', 'genetic predictors', 'individualized medicine', 'lung injury', 'mathematical model', 'molecular pathology', 'multiorgan injury', 'nonhuman primate', 'older patient', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'repaired', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virology', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,P20,2020,379884,-0.03604372679143367
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies.

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model.

"Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. We propose to build an open-source scalable generalizable method that would assist experimentalists and clinicians on assessing patient's risk of developing therapy resistance and would establish a foundation for our long-term goal to build a platform for patient-centric clinical decision making, personalized therapeutic advice, and disease management.  We propose to develop a generalizable versatile bioinformatics paradigm that will use patient molecular profiles to PREDICT their Therapy Response, PREDICTTR, which combines network analysis, statistical modeling, and ensemble machine learning in a unique innovative way that allows accurate elucidation of complex multi-level relationships that govern treatment response. The objective of our proposed approach is two-fold: (i) uncover molecular markers and valuable candidates for therapeutic intervention, which can potentially be targeted to preclude or overcome resistance; and (ii) predict patient's response to therapy administration, which holds a long-term promise to improve disease outcome and reduce the cost of unnecessary and ineffective treatments.  Motivated by increasing cases of treatment resistance in oncology, we will apply our algorithm to elucidate (i) response to androgen targeting in prostate cancer and (ii) response to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We will disseminate our approach through a web-based decision- making tool, which will be implemented through a Hadoop-oriented solution to (i) broaden its practical impact and (ii) establish clinical utility. Taken together, this multi-task resource is a unique innovative effort of its kind in the therapeutic resistance space with a direct broad impact on personalized therapeutic advice and disease management. Even though we will train our model in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, our approach can be easily and broadly applicable to other therapies and diseases.  This effort will be led by an Early Stage Investigator, Antonina Mitrofanova (PI) who has extensive training and expertise in biomedical informatics and big data analytics. Her collaborative team includes Dr. Shantenu Jha (Rutgers, co-I) who is an expert in distributed systems and will advise on Hadoop development and validation; Dr. Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide clinical and sequencing patient data and incorporate the utilization of our method into the Rutgers CINJ Molecular Tumor Board; Dr. Isaac Kim (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide additional data for validation in prostate cancer; Dr. Christopher Hourigan (NHLBI , NIH, Significant Collaborator), who will provide data for clinical validation in acute myeloid leukemia and is committed to test our web-based portal; and Dr. Scott Parrott (Rutgers, co-I), who is an expert in statistical analysis and will consult on power calculations and multiple testing corrections.

"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space. The implications of this work are broad including diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitoring tools, and research tools to enable longitudinal isolation of disease-inducing cells or non-invasive protein measurements from a single host without euthanasia.",Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring,10054726,K99EB028840,"['Adaptive Immune System', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biosensor', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Euthanasia', 'Event', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Extravasation', 'Flare', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foreign Bodies', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homing', 'Hydrogels', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Implant', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'Natural Immunity', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuraxis', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Phagocytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteolipids', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'caprolactone', 'career', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'fluorophore', 'glucose monitor', 'imaging approach', 'immunoengineering', 'immunological status', 'implant material', 'implanted sensor', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'liquid biopsy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'optical sensor', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'small molecule', 'subcutaneous', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K99,2020,91800,-0.0032841781298275285
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,10017191,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,254179,0.017733683985990234
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9856137,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74758,-0.01676541647389541
"Comprehensive Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy Response Project Summary  Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) immunotherapies can result in robust and durable disease control in many advanced malignancies, and their use is transforming cancer care. Despite the growing adoption, however, ICIs are effective in <30% of patients and can cause significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in up to ~60% of treated patients. Early determination of which patient will respond and/or develop irAEs remains a great challenge due to the complex interplay of tumor response, toxicity in critical organs, and overall patterns of immune activation. Further complicating their use, ICI costs are high ($100k-$250k annually/patient; total Medicare Part B payment for ICIs in 2018 >$4 billion). A comprehensive assessment of early ICI therapeutic response and toxicity would provide oncologists with timely, actionable information to better balance benefits and risks, improve patient outcomes, reduce toxicities and lower healthcare costs.  Molecular imaging is an invaluable tool for assessing spatial and temporal changes in tumors, damage to critical organs and immune activation during immunotherapies. Unfortunately, current assessments require manually evaluating a subset of disease sites, which is both laborious and subjective. Immunotherapies’ unique mechanism of action often gives rise to novel imaging patterns of tumor response (e.g. pseudoprogression) that cannot be easily resolved by current methods. Disease response, organ toxicity, and lymphoid tissue immune activation are interdependent. Information on all three of these aspects of response must be known to capture the complete landscape of immunotherapy response. The status quo in assessing response not only fails to fully extract clinically significant information from the imaging data, but also provides very limited information to medical oncologists for improved overall patient management. To address this unmet need, AIQ Solutions (Madison, WI) proposes to develop ImmunIQ , a software product that provides a comprehensive view of immunotherapy response. Specifically, ImmunIQ will automatically and simultaneously assess: (1) response of all tumor lesions, (2) immune-related toxicities in critical organs, and (3) immune activation. Upon successful completion of Phase I, we will have a functional software prototype. In Phase II, we will clinically validate the platform with outcome and irAE data and develop a prototype ready for commercialization and FDA 510(k) submission. Project Narrative Immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies have been transforming the treatment strategies in many advanced malignancies, however despite the growing adoption, it suffers from significant challenges, including low response rate, high incidence of immune-related adverse events, and high treatment costs.

"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population.

"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9991796,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal condition', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,645963,-0.035490518027194516
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9895622,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2020,449434,0.015745066902504337
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9817679,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2020,229500,-0.020044555759756836
"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy. Project Narrative We will study how immune system genes affect the success of transplantation for patients of diverse ancestries.

"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome. The major goals of our project are to (1) develop computational modeling techniques to design perturbations that can steer the microbiome to desired states and (2) design next-generation bacterial therapeutics that sense major gut microbiome-produced metabolites and deliver selective antimicrobials to shift microbiome states to ameliorate CVD.",Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease,10044931,R01EB030340,"['Address', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bacteroides', 'Behavior', 'Biosensor', 'Butyrates', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Scientist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human disease', 'lysin', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'trimethylamine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,697498,0.02861114858543411
"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10056490,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,281780,0.04468474628945542
"Immune cells and STAT3-mediated inflammation in calcific aortic valve disease PROJECT SUMMARY Aortic valve disease is the third most common cardiovascular disease in the United States. Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is by far the most common cause, yet it has no effective pharmacologic therapy. Currently, all theories of pathophysiology focus on the contribution of resident aortic valve interstitial and endothelial cells (AVICs and AVECs respectively). However, macrophages make up a significant fraction of the native aortic valve, and pathology studies and unbiased transcriptomics of the calcified aortic valve have observed enrichment of macrophages and T and B lymphocytes. In addition, transcription factor STAT3 and its key activator IL-6 –both markers of Th17 inflammation – have been found to be increased in in vitro and in vivo calcification. Recognizing the interplay of immune cell function with endothelial and cardiovascular biology, we have begun to investigate the contribution of immune cells to CAVD pathophysiology. Our in vitro studies of STAT3 blockade show an abrogation of mechanical and transcript-level characteristics of dystrophic calcification. In addition, culture of aortic valve cells with macrophages augments the calcification phenotype. This background information and preliminary data suggest a mechanism for immune cell contribution to the pathophysiology of CAVD. Specifically, we suspect that known calcification stimuli induce an inflammatory phenotype in hematopoietic cells, leading to T lymphocyte infiltration and STAT3-dependent calcific nodule formation. In Aim 1 we will utilize bone marrow transplants and inhibition of lymphocyte maturation via Rag1 knockout to test the role of hematopoietic cells on the whole and lymphocytes, respectively, in the Notch1+/- mouse model of CAVD. To test the impact of in vitro models of calcification on immune cells, in Aim 2 we will utilize in vitro co-culture models of AVICs and macrophages, and probe the effects on STAT3 signaling and AVIC calcification. Aim 2 will interrogate both the calcification outcomes of valvular cells and the immunological outcomes of macrophages. To test the clinical translation of this model, in Aim 3 we will assess the progression of aortic stenosis in patients taking methotrexate, a drug that inhibits T lymphocyte maturation and thus adaptive immune system activity. With these investigations, this project will (a) be the first to mechanistically assess the impact of immune cells in CAVD, (b) contribute directly to the clinical knowledge base on aortic valve disease, and (c) advance the basic science understanding of immune cell physiology under mechanical strain. Finally, this project will not only advance scientific knowledge on aortic valve disease, but further serve as the foundation of my training to be an independent physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis is a common and insidious disease that can lead to heart failure and death. Calcific aortic valve disease, the leading cause of aortic stenosis, has no pharmacologic therapy due to a limited understanding of pathophysiology, but characterization studies have shown an increased immune infiltrate. This project aims to identify the contribution of macrophages and T lymphocytes to this disease process, allowing for targeted therapies and risk modification early in the disease course which could decrease the prevalence of related morbidity and mortality.",Immune cells and STAT3-mediated inflammation in calcific aortic valve disease,9907624,F30HL147464,"['Adaptive Immune System', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Antimetabolites', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coxibs', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Dystrophic Calcification', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Vitro', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Interleukin 6 Receptor', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mature T-Lymphocyte', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Rag1 Mouse', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Stimulus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'aortic valve replacement', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'celecoxib', 'clinical translation', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'cytokine', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial cell', 'knowledge base', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'protective effect', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,21789,-0.022278147407389474
"Accurate prediction of neutralization capacity from deep mining of SARS-CoV-2 serology ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish an accurate and sensitive method for predicting the neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 of serum samples by deep mining of antibody profiles. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat with nearly seven million cases and 400K deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and therapeutics, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a main mechanism of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re)infection. Our recent studies of convalescent serum samples revealed that their levels of neutralization capacity vary greatly (over 100-fold) and only a small subset has high neutralization capacity. Because viral neutralization assays are inherently low throughput, it is unrealistic to apply it to a high-risk population such as hospital workers in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there is only moderate correlation between the neutralization capacity and the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels determined using standard ELISA. Clearly, we still do not understand what types of antibodies contribute to viral neutralization. Our overarching hypothesis to be tested in this project is that by examining the antibody profile in patient serum more deeply and quantitatively in terms of antigens, epitopes and antibody types, we will be able to identify quantitative predictive markers for viral neutralization. To this end, we will develop multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 serology that will enable us to deeply characterize the antibody profile. We will then develop a predictive algorithm by utilizing. We have assembled a team of experts with truly complementary skills in antibody characterization, virology and data mining. We have access to a large number of convalescent serum samples, which will enable us to critically validate our technology. We will expeditiously execute the following aims. (1) We will develop multiplex serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 that can profile up to 15 antibody-antigen interactions in a single reaction. The main technical innovation is the introduction of multi-dimensional flow cytometry. We will produce multiple antigens including Spike, receptor-binding domain and nucleocapsid protein, and their natural and designed variants. We will refine and validate the assay using a large panel of convalescent serum samples. (2) We will develop an improved viral neutralization assay to better quantify the neutralization capacity. (3) We will develop a predictive algorithm for neutralization capacity that utilizes the antibody profiles from our multiplex assay. This analysis will identify serology parameters that contribute to neutralization. The end products of this project will include a high-throughput serology assay that gives far- richer antibody profiles than the current standard accompanied with an accurate predictive algorithm. Together, this platform will help advance a fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the development of vaccines and therapeutics against this formidable pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples of people exposed to the virus vary greatly, and current antibody testing methods do not accurately determine the level of neutralizing antibodies. This project will develop innovative platform for deep mining of antibody profiles from a small amount of blood samples and accurately predict their neutralization capacity.

"Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC Title: Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with and without NEC Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity that frequently results in death (20- 50%) or severe systemic complications. Although NEC is a multifactorial disease, its precise etiology continues to be poorly understood. As such, there are still no effective prevention methods or treatments available. Given increased intestinal and systemic inflammation seen in NEC, it is likely that the dysregulation of the immune system contributes to its pathogenesis. In order to better understand NEC pathogenesis, it is essential to have a solid understanding of normal immune development that occurs over the first two months of age in premature infants. Our preliminary data obtained from fetuses, patients with NEC and control subjects, show that there is a drastic reduction of total and tissue resident memory T cells in the intestinal tissue and an increase in T cells in the periphery. Moreover, NEC is associated with a significant increase in pro-inflammatory macrophages in intestinal tissue, and a concomitant decrease in circulating monocytes. Recent work has begun to address how neonatal peripheral immunity develops. However, data on the peripheral immune development in premature infants over the first two months of life is sparse. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory proposal is to define normal immune development of premature infants over the first two months of life and characterize its dysregulation in patients with NEC. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that development of the peripheral immune system in preterm infants is different in the innate and adaptive immune compartments from that of term infants, and it is this difference that makes them susceptible to NEC. As the blood volume in premature infants is limited, we have developed a methodology to perform deep immunophenotyping on as little as 100 µliters of blood using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF). This unique methodology will allow us to address the hypothesis, with the following aims: 1) Define the peripheral immune development of premature infants (<32 weeks) over the first two months of life. We will perform CyTOF on peripheral blood from 50 premature infants, with samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Deep characterization of the immune cell landscape and maps of the developmental trajectories of the major cell lineages in premature infants will be generated. 2) Identify peripheral immune cell abnormalities associated with the development of NEC. We will identify dysregulation of immune population trajectories specific to premature infants who develop NEC. This information will provide us with a model for the immune cell mechanism underlying susceptibility to NEC. This project would represent the first detailed deep examination of the development of the immune system in premature infants with and without NEC over the first two months, and will provide sufficient data for the development of a large-scale, in-depth study of the mechanism underlying the development of NEC. Project Narrative: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of premature birth that frequently results in significant mortality and morbidity the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. A better understanding of the development of the immune system in premature infants would allow for improved methods to prevent and treat NEC. We propose to use state of the art methods to define the immune system in premature infants in the first two months of life, in order to provide a foundation for further research into the development of treatments for NEC.",Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC,10038410,R21HD102565,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucosal Immune System', 'Mus', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Secondary to', 'Small Intestines', 'Solid', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'cell type', 'cost estimate', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'peripheral blood', 'premature', 'prevent', 'specific biomarkers', 'therapy development']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,223344,0.0003130942013654017
"Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) in western populations is estimated at around ~3%. Clinically, IA present a dilemma, in that they are usually asymptomatic; however, IA are extremely dangerous if they rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (~50% mortality). There is convincing evidence that continued IA growth increases the risk of rupture (12-24 times). To better monitor and predict IA progression, there is a compelling need to better understand clinical IA growth (aneurysmal remodeling). 90% of IA occur within the arteries of the Circle of Willis (CoW). Despite there being overwhelming evidence connecting CoW vascular remodeling and IA disease, the majority of IA research focuses only on the IA site, and does not consider the contribution of connected arteries. Specific vascular remodeling in the CoW arteries may provide an additional indicator for monitoring IA progression. The biochemical processes that occur at the IA site include inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling leading to cell death and vessel wall degeneration. Analyses in animal models have strongly connected arterial wall shear stress (WSS) as a trigger of these processes, leading to IA initiation and remodeling. Patient-oriented research has further linked areas of low WSS with IA growth. Because CoW vasculature can change during IA growth, the blood flow entering IA changes and may create a new level of WSS to stabilize the remodeling process. Better understanding how human IA may naturally stabilize is highly relevant to predicting IA progression, and the role of changing WSS will be investigated in this grant. In our recent study of 520 clinically monitored IA, we found that while many IA grew consistently, following a projected growth path, others became stable. We also found that IA growth speed is significantly faster in women. Given the association of IA with sex, family history, and disease, different patterns of vascular remodeling may occur within groups with different genetics or medical history. We propose a clinical translational study to study IA growth in different genetic and medical history groups. We hypothesize IA growth may associate with patterns of vascular remodeling within the CoW. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) Is IA growth a local phenomenon or it associated with vascular remodeling within the CoW? (2) Do genetically similar individuals undergo similar patterns of vascular remodeling? (3) Does blood flow within the CoW associate with vascular remodeling? By identifying how IA disease progression may associate with other remodeling within the CoW, this study can identify new imaging biomarkers that enable improved IA treatment decisions. This proposal is significant because there is an unmet need to accurately assess IA disease progression and changes in risk. This proposal is innovative because it will extend existing IA studies to include more, relevant cerebrovascular arteries and longitudinal data, while implementing several technical innovations specific to this problem which can translate to clinical tracking of cerebrovascular changes PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms are extremely dangerous when they rupture. When one is detected, it may be treated or monitored through imaging, with aneurysm growth a strong indication of increased risk of rupture.

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease.

"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications.

"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats.

"A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to more than 470,000 deaths. This disease is especially perilous for the elderly - 80% of deaths in the US have been individuals over the age of 65, and the social isolation created by lockdowns have increased risks of serious physical and mental health issues.  COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild (e.g. loss of smell, dry cough) to critical (e.g. cytokine storm, renal failure, cardiovascular damage, respiratory failure, lethal blood clotting, neurological disorders). This clinical heterogeneity demands a precision medicine approach that elucidates distinct pathways underlying the disease, develops treatments for each pathway, and defines biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification within the subsets. A key benefit of precision medicine is that drugs may be repurposed or may already exist to treat specific subsets of infected individuals. For example, one critical outcome for COVID-19 infection is the onset of a cytokine storm, in which the body's immune system gets caught in a positive feedback loop, leading to shock and rapid failure of multiple organs. There are existing drugs for treating cytokine storm syndrome, but practitioners have no clear guidelines if such treatments are beneficial or destructive. If the individual is not in a hyperinflammatory state, the administration of these drugs could cripple their immune response, leading to increased viral load. Plasma biomarker patterns of proteins and metabolites hold potential to identify impending cytokine storms and other lethal outcomes.  To advance precision medicine for COVID-19 treatment, this work will generate large-scale omics data and evaluate levels of proteins and metabolites for plasma drawn from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 normal controls. These data will be immediately released to the research community. Our research team will take a concerted multipronged approach for analyzing these data using diverse complementary techniques. Our labs' research focuses on the discovery of combinations of genes and proteins expressing synchronously and the associations of these combinations with traits of interest, as well as endophenotype discovery. In addition to thorough single analyte analyses, this research will employ three computational strategies to reveal combinations of factors defining patterns: 1) network modeling, 2) explainable-AI systems biology, and 3) linear programming. These intensive analyses will require significant computational resources and we will utilize Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, for these tasks.  The comprehensive protein and metabolite profiles, based on a large cohort of COVID-19 cases and normal controls, along with our rigorous interrogation of these data for complex biomarker patterns indicative of patient outcomes, hold unprecedented potential to drive solid advances in precision medicine and to reduce mortality rates due to COVID-19. In addition, this research will provide an agile model for use when tackling other heterogeneous diseases plaguing humankind, as well as novel viruses that may arise in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic is exceptionally detrimental for the elderly, as they comprise 80% of deaths in the US and are at elevated risks for serious physical and mental health issues due to social isolation. COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits a range of diverse symptoms, demanding a precision medicine approach in which treatments for each distinct outcome are developed, biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification into an outcome group are defined, and new candidate drug targets are generated for each outcome. In order to lay the foundation for a precision medicine approach for treating COVID-19, this work will generate a highly-phenotyped large-scale omics dataset including blood proteomics and metabolomics from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 uninfected healthy individuals and will intensely analyze these data using diverse complementary high-performance computing techniques, including network modeling with enhanced accuracy, explainable-AI systems biology incorporating diverse data, and pioneering linear programming producing optimal associations, thereby illuminating complex proteomic and metabolomic biomarker patterns associated with each critical disease outcome and generating novel candidate drug targets.",A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways,10202278,RF1AG053303,"['2019-nCoV', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood coagulation', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Programming', 'Mental Health', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Mutate', 'Natural Selections', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shock', 'Smell Perception', 'Social isolation', 'Solid', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'computing resources', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'fighting', 'human old age (65+)', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor', 'response', 'statistics', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,650002,-0.0007879835750745116
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9892997,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lipid metabolism', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10019521,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2020,1832307,0.007591871341072195
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9854874,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2020,185224,0.024143798892841566
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,0.0003782896031958578
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,9998187,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,824479,-0.019249558886594763
"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,9933446,R01GM136659,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Behavior', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermis', 'Development', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hair follicle structure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hydrogels', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Papillary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surface', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transposase', 'United States', 'Verteporfin', 'Visual', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'functional loss', 'healing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skin regeneration', 'skin wound', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'wound', 'wound bed', 'wound environment', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,317823,-0.024026469475591207
"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9975724,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,191195,-0.07274421794266478
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,-0.0048868052568413305
"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Arboviruses', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytoplasmic Inclusion', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'Encephalitis', 'Enterovirus', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nodule', 'Nuclear Inclusion', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Virus Infections', 'RNA Viruses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Specimen', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'deep sequencing', 'fungus', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'prospective test', 'rRNA Genes', 'rapid diagnosis', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection', 'viral genomics', 'virology', 'virus identification', 'whole genome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,480375,-0.021118014634742582
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9922844,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1755886,0.03507747696539366
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,9862588,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,681780,0.023205641488484
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9989920,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,511458,0.02875962718741919
"Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition Over 50% of postmenopausal women are affected by the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and sexual dysfunction. Symptoms worsen if untreated and are associated with stress and depression. Estrogen decline in menopause is thought to lead to reduced glycogen accumulation in the vaginal epithelium and is associated with low vaginal Lactobacillus spp. levels in 50-80% of women. Lactobacillus spp. protect the urogenital tract from pathogens in part by producing lactic acid and for their anti-inflammatory properties, but whether lactobacilli are a marker for estrogen levels or play a functional role in GSM is unknown. Available treatments for vulvovaginal GSM symptoms have limitations. Some women are contraindicated for hormonal therapy or are concerned with side effects. Vaginal lubricants provide some relief, but they may be toxic to the vaginal epithelium, reduce lactobacilli, and raise urogenital infection risk. New therapies are needed. Vaginal microbiota are a plausible approach to treatment, however, probiotics alone have not proven effective. Vaginal microbiota co-vary with metabolite and immune profiles, and it is unknown how these molecular features relate to GSM. We hypothesize that core vaginal microenvironment biomarkers (VMB; e.g., microbial, metabolite, and immune profiles) reflect vaginal biological aging (V-BA) that is increased by menopause but may also be modifiable by other factors, such as lifestyle. Longitudinal studies are needed to identify core age-related VMB and determine how they relate to GSM. To accomplish this task, we will develop new statistical methods to combine complex longitudinal epidemiologic data with high- dimensional compositional data. We will leverage 2,301 archived cervicovaginal samples collected as part of a cohort of 812 women aged 35-60 years with visits every six months for two years (R01-CA123467). Specific Aims are to 1) quantify V-BA using VMB; 2) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between V-BA and GSM; 3) longitudinally assess the relationship of lifestyle factors on V-BA and VMB; 4) quantify longitudinal mediation by V-BA and VMB between lifestyle and GSM. Microbiota are already profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (R21-AI107224). Along with clinical, demographic, and behavioral surveys, we will 1) use cervical secretions and multiplexed bead-based immune-assays to quantify concentrations of 70 immune markers (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors); 2) profile metabolites from vaginal swabs (GC/LC-MS). This proposal is focused on developing and validating new statistical methods that refine and adapt modern structural modeling and microbiota compositional analyses. The novel statistical approaches will allow identification of vaginal microenvironment features which may lead to development of new and effective GSM treatments. These methods will also provide a new framework to handle missing data and confounding that has limited prior microbiome studies. Our team has the multidisciplinary expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging, gynecology, genomics, microbiology, and immunology required for a new systems-biology approach to GSM. Over 50% of postmenopausal women report genitourinary symptoms which result in detriments to their quality of life. Changes in the normal and protective vaginal bacteria (termed vaginal microbiota) accelerate in menopause transition for some women and have been associated with a higher burden of urogenital symptoms; therefore, we aim to determine how vaginal bacterial, metabolite, and immune profiles relate to genitourinary symptoms over time in a large study. The public health impact is to identify molecular targets of intervention which will improve postmenopausal vaginal health and lengthen women's healthspan, a key NIA mission.","Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition",10229293,R56AG068673,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Archives', 'Atrophic', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Body mass index', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Dryness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Therapy', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Gynecology', 'Health', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Inflammaging', 'Intervention', 'Kynurenine', 'Lactic acid', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lubricants', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Menopausal Symptom', 'Menopausal Syndrome', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Perimenopause', 'Play', 'Postmenopause', 'Prevotella', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Functioning', 'Sexual Dysfunction', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Streptococcus', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taurine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'dietary supplements', 'epidemiologic data', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'hormonal contraception', 'hormone therapy', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'preservation', 'repository', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'urogenital tract', 'vaginal dryness', 'vaginal lactobacilli', 'vaginal microbiota', 'vaginal mucosa']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R56,2020,795662,0.010107205621813036
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,10020883,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'data analysis pipeline', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2020,123096,0.0009911245506568913
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,0.03100228801235023
