"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium. RELEVANCE The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is a highly collaborative effort aiming to develop a comprehensive list of functional elements in the human genome. This proposal creates a data analysis center to provide support and computational prowess for this effort in collaboration with other ENCODE groups. This comprehensive list will be of use to the wider research community and will aid in understanding human biology particularly in the context of disease, ultimately leading to improvements in human health.",EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center,10240955,U24HG009446,"['ATAC-seq', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Leadership', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'data exchange', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data standards', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high throughput analysis', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mouse genome', 'multiple data types', 'novel', 'symposium', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U24,2021,1975273
"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10271402,R21MD014658,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Calibration', 'Censuses', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Fairs', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Kansas', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oklahoma', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Probability Samples', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cigarette smoking', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'simulation', 'smoking prevalence', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tribal health']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2021,109613
