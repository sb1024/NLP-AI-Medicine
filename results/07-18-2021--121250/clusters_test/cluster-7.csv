"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data. The Reactome database and web site enable scientists, clinicians, researchers, students, and educators to find, organize, and utilize biological information to support data visualization, integration and analysis.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,10111538,U41HG003751,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Applications Grants', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'clinically significant', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'tool', 'web site']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2021,1354555
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10256801,R35GM138241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Devices', 'Dioxygen', 'Disease', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Nature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Transition Elements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'combat', 'extracellular', 'gut microbiota', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'microorganism culture', 'nano', 'nanomaterials', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2021,371084
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,10213202,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'dietary', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2021,981634
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10202634,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,322545
"Non-target analysis of maternal and cord blood samples: Advancing computational tools and discovering novel chemicals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Non-targeted analysis (NTA) provides a comprehensive approach to analyze environmental and biological samples for nearly all chemicals present. Despite the recent advancements in NTA, the number of confirmed chemicals with analytical standards remains fairly small compared to the number of detected features. There is, thus, a need to further develop computational tools to derive more chemical structures and leverage the full potential of HRMS. Enhancing our ability to derive more chemical structures will enable the discovery of new industrial chemicals that humans are exposed to, especially in critical windows of development, such as pregnancy. It will also enable the discovery of endogenously produced metabolites that may be related to biological outcomes of importance, such as preterm birth. The objective of my proposal is to develop novel computational methods to significantly advance our ability to analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and apply them to study prenatal exposures to industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites in a large cohort of pregnant women from Northern California. My proposal builds on my expertise in analytical and environmental chemistry and my current postdoctoral experience in computational chemistry and applications in human exposure. I seek additional training to develop and apply innovative computational methods to better characterize the human exposome and in particular the exposome of preterm birth. The contribution of my proposal will be two-fold: (1) developing novel computational structure-prediction algorithms for HRMS datasets based on MS data and physicochemical properties (equilibrium partition ratios between organic solvents and water, e.g., octanol/water, chlorobenzene/water, diethyl ether/water etc.) (Aim 1) and apply them to derive potential structures for chemical features detected in a HRMS dataset from 340 maternal and 340 matched cord blood samples to complement the limited number of chemicals identified through MS/MS and analytical standards (Aim 2); and (2) study the interplay between the exposome and the metabolome in preterm birth using molecular interaction networks to visualize and compare how molecular interactions between industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites differ between preterm and full-term birth (Aim 3). The K99 training will expand my prior research experience through coursework, research apprenticeship, and mentored reading, with specific training in: (1) advanced analytical skills including -omics data analysis, machine learning, and biostatistics; (2) epidemiology, risk assessment, human exposure to chemical stressors; and (3) human pregnancy and development. The skills acquired during this award are critical to my long-term goal to advance computational methods to better analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data to support efforts to better characterize the human exposome. This work will produce new scientific knowledge to greatly advance the understanding of the influence of environmental exposures in the development of adverse health outcomes and in particular, preterm birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offer unique opportunities to study the human exposome and the development of adverse health outcomes.

"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,10130568,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,496674
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,10160925,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2021,385000
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10105344,R01GM132386,"['Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Occupations', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biophysical model', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'macromolecule', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleic acid-based therapeutics', 'open data', 'open source', 'physical model', 'physical property', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,608856
"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases,10099051,R01HD103727,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Response', 'Apoptotic', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bulla', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Field Flow Fractionation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Grant', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Location', 'MLLT2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Vesicle', 'Woman', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'first responder', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'microvesicles', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanosized', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2021,542123
"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is devoted to the development of a novel integrative, structure-based, artificial intelligence driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein.

"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,10074602,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,750747
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,10197115,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology. The complexity of representing chemical graphs and the lack of thorough curation leads to frequent small molecule structure errors, which propagate across digital research assets, impeding their interoperability and reusability.

"Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility Project Summary Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems. A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion or the transport of extracellular liquid over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity. The biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules, mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly. This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the treatment of ciliopathies. Project Narrative Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles that produce a driving force for cellular locomotion or fluid flow. In humans, defects in motile cilia can lead to infertility, chronic respiratory disease, and even reversal of the orientation of the bodily organs. This project aims to reveal the detailed workings of the mechanoregulatory network that controls ciliary motility, which will help us to better understand the molecular basis of cilia-related diseases.",Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility,10180150,R01GM141109,"['Algae', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii', 'Chronic', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Electrons', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Machines', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oocytes', 'Organ', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory System', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell motility', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium motility', 'crosslink', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'fluid flow', 'insight', 'nexin', 'novel', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory virus', 'sperm cell']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,414050
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,10112245,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312660
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Systematic identification of RNA sequences and protein components regulating circular RNA translation PROJECT SUMMARY  The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.  I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al., resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i) identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii) identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA species (linear vs. circular RNAs).  This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually- stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical implications of circRNA.

"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,10168567,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,321398
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).

"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,10126805,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,1224163
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales. Our experiments and modeling will help to understand the mechanisms of embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong correlation between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular disease? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering.",Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi,10165811,R01HL148227,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopolymers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytolysis', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evolution', 'Fiber', 'Fibrin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fracture', 'Frustration', 'Gel', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hydrogels', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rupture', 'Specimen', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thermodynamics', 'Thick', 'Thrombin', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Traction', 'Work', 'base', 'crosslink', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'fiber cell', 'fluid flow', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'materials science', 'mechanical properties', 'models and simulation', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular scale', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nanoscale', 'neutrophil', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'simulation', 'synergism', 'theories', 'thrombotic', 'tool', 'venous thromboembolism', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,639595
"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,10158011,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2021,31030
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,10116306,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'antibody test', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,591130
"Utilization of Advanced Technologies for the Understanding of Human Structural Birth Defects PROJECT SUMMARY The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation. In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid- gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell- type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other, and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when developmentally important genes are lost. In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible. Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’ samples. The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic.

"Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10405294,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2021,2500
"Learning to learn in structural biology with deep neural networks Project Summary/Abstract  Deep learning is gaining traction across many elds as a powerful tool. In medicine, there have been recent successes in drug design, predicting protein structure, and in functional genomics. These successes have thus far been in areas where there are hundreds of thousands of data points and deep learning in medicine is still limited by lack of large homongeous datasets.  This proposal focuses on applying a new kind of deep learning called meta-learning that mimics the human-like ability to learn from few examples. The PI will establish a sustainable research program on meta-learning by developing benchmark problems and datasets. The PI will further explore meta-learning speci cally on peptide-protein structure and NMR spectra prediction. Due to the imperative need for interpretability when using deep learning in medicine, a strong component will be connecting biophysical modeling with the deep learning models.  The outcome of this work will be a demonstrated new approach to deep learning that can work with little data. The PI will bring these research ideas together to design peptides that can bind to intrinsically disordred proteins, a challenging but important task for curing neurodegenerative diseases. This will be accomplished through meta-learning, molecular simulation, and iterative peptide design. Project Narrative  Deep learning is a technique from arti cial intelligence that has driven many high-pro le break- throughs in recognizing objects in images, translating human languages, and playing games like Chess and Go. Its use is medicine is currently limited by deep learning's need for large amounts of data and its lack of interpretability.

"Unified Computation Tools for Natural Products Research Summary The overarching goal for this proposed renewal application will be to further advance tools that are in development and to effectively integrate several types of analytical data with biological assay data and genomic information. This will create a powerful set of tools for faster and even more accurate identification of new molecules, dereplication of known ones, and to directly infer biological activities from spectroscopic information. In the current period of support, we have made substantial progress in developing highly useful tools for automatic annotations and identifications of organic molecules, specifically focused on natural products. The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis and knowledge dissemination ecosystem has processed almost 160,000 jobs in nearly 160 countries worldwide, has 4-6,000 new job submissions per month and is accessed over 200,000 times a month (majority accessions are for reference library access, inspection of public data and previous jobs that the community shares as hyperlinks in papers), and has become a mainstream tool for the annotation of organic molecules deriving from diverse sources, especially in metabolomics workflows. The public website for Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), a deep learning model for providing candidate structures based on 1H-13C HSQC NMR data, went live in December 2019 and already has over 3000 jobs in 50 countries. All tools developed in this proposal will become part of this analysis ecosystem. The four laboratories contributing to this proposed research activity have created an open and integrated team that is continuing to creatively innovate new informatic tools to enhance small molecule structure annotations and inference of their chemical and biological properties. We have four specific aims: 1) To complete the development and evaluation of a set of new and innovative tools for natural products analysis, and deploy these as freely available resources for the worldwide community. 2) To refine the structural characterization of molecules through leveraging repository scale mass spectral information along with NMR data and genomic inputs. 3) To create a new SMART-based tool that integrates mass spectrometry and HSQC NMR data as the input for a new deep learning system with the goal of achieving more accurate predictions of structure. 4) To use deep learning to enhance SMART with bioactivity data so as to enable SMART to predict activities of molecules based on spectroscopic features. The data will also augment the GNPS database with biological assay binding data. An additional consequence of these goals will be the further digitization of natural products analytical data so that they can be used in the computational tools planned herein, as well as other tools in the future.

"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10264175,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2021,521758
"Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) PROJECT SUMMARY  Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time- consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories, including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants; solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.  Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy, and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2 protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means. PROJECT NARRATIVE Knowledge of macromolecular structure plays a crucial role in biology and medicine, allowing for detailed studies and understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. Yet, relatively few structures are obtained experimentally - the rest must be modeled.

"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Speed', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'models and simulation', 'molecular modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein structure function', 'ribosome profiling', 'simulation', 'transcriptome', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,10166848,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2021,457521
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,10109124,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,314000
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10405893,R00HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R00,2021,249000
