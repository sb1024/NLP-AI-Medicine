"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR . NARRATIVE More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease. While the CDC conventional standard two-tier approach for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement.

"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria. Upon completion, this project will provide a global view of the interplay between recombination and adaptative evolution across hundreds of bacterial species.",Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes,10135120,R01GM132137,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Spottings', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'gene function', 'genome analysis', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'homologous recombination', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'novel strategies', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R01,2021,289206
"Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours. NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.  The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC, including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in- Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4- dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet (breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ injury. These studies promise to significantly advance the field of NEC, and to offer specific therapies for it. Project Narrative Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and for which there exists no effective cure. The current proposal has identified four major questions in the field of NEC which we now seek to answer, through a novel focus on identifying what causes NEC, how we can prevent NEC, how we can predict NEC, and how we can reduce the impact of NEC on causing long term complications on the brain, the gut and the lung.",Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis,10206378,R35GM141956,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laparotomy', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Premature Infant', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TLR4 gene', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Writing', 'experience', 'feeding', 'human tissue', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'intestinal epithelium', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ injury', 'prediction algorithm', 'premature', 'prevent', 'receptor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,409375
"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,10092924,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'rapid test', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2021,199831
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),10170251,U01AI151807,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Animals', 'Arbovirus Infections', 'Arboviruses', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brazil', 'Central America', 'Chikungunya virus', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Deforestation', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Habitats', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Panama', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'South America', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Venezuela', 'Virus', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'Zoonoses', 'chikungunya', 'climate change', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'enzootic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'insight', 'nanobodies', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prospective', 'seroconversion', 'surveillance network', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector control', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2021,1519214
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis.

"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10140073,R44GM140607,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Ebola', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Oncology', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Poxviridae', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Transcript', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'adaptive immune response', 'analytical method', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polyclonal antibody', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"DIGITAL PROTEOMICS, LLC",R44,2021,802944
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865
"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,10111555,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319844
"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19.

"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10171553,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serology test', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2021,201875
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,10082437,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319318
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases. This approach will dramatically improve the care of otherwise-neglected patients with rare diseases.",Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases,10220648,R01AI153827,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Awareness', 'Bronchiectasis', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Report Form', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunological Diagnosis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical data warehouse', 'collaborative approach', 'congenital immunodeficiency', 'cost', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'falls', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,806368
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,600979
"The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants PROJECT SUMMARY  Infancy is increasingly being recognized as a key time point of microbiome establishment that impacts neonatal health as well as later outcomes. The intestinal microbiome has specifically been implicated in neurologic outcomes via the gut-brain axis. However, means by which the intestinal microbiome can have influence on the brain are poorly understood. The preterm infant is at the nexus of these unknowns. Preterm infants are a vulnerable patient population at risk for significant poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Preterm infant brain development occurs in parallel with intestinal microbiome development, thus modification of the intestinal microbiome is a potential means of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that distinct gut microbiome taxa and metabolites at key time points improve preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.  Our preliminary and published data in gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that different early preterm infant microbiota impact neuron number, myelination, and behavior. This proposal will use our ongoing MIND (Microbiome In Neonatal Development) preterm infant cohort to determine how the gut microbiome impacts neurodevelopmental potential in the NICU, and how it may alter neurodevelopmental trajectories post- NICU discharge. We will conduct longitudinal sampling of participant fecal and blood samples to monitor gut microbiome as well as fecal and serum metabolites. We will also perform neurodevelopmental testing during the NICU course and up until preschool/school age (3.5-5 years old). School readiness, which describes children's strengths, challenges, and needs for supports when learning in the classroom, is a functional outcome that differs from single summary measures of intelligence (IQ) and will be the outcome measure.  A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metabonomics will be applied to the collected fecal samples. Sophisticated machine learning strategies will be used to develop novel models of preterm infant gut microbiome succession with time as a critical element. Serum cytokine analysis and metabonomics will provide mechanistic insight into how the gut microbiome may be impacting neurodevelopment. We have established complementary in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models, in which germ-free mice are transfaunated with preterm infant microbiota. This state-of-the-art experimental model will allow specific investigation of the impact of clinically relevant microbiota on brain development that is not possible in human infants. The goal of this proposal is to discover intestinal microbiome patterns associated with school readiness, identify the key time points that represent windows of opportunity for microbiome optimization, and identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome impacts brain development and behavior. This new knowledge will enhance our understanding of the gut-brain axis and lay the foundation for microbial based therapeutics to improve infant neurodevelopmental trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE The intestinal microbiome has impact beyond the gut and the existence of a gut-brain axis has been proposed. Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This proposal will study how the changes in bacterial colonization patterns of preterm infants over time from birth until school age impact brain development, and thus school readiness and learning for these vulnerable infants.",The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants,10200392,R01HD105234,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '5 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genes', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurons', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy design']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,705079
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dietary', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301
"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies.

"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship.

"In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression ABSTRACT The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which early this year forced entire countries into lockdown, has reached a global death toll of 890,000+ by early September 2020. Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic but infectious, an estimated reproductive rate of infection of about 2 and a high mutation rate, it is expected that the virus will remain in the population as the influenza virus does. For hospitals serving areas whose economy relies on international travel, tourism, and cruise ship tourism, such as Miami-Dade county, new COVID-19 cases related to travel will require treatment during infection outbreaks which will strain health systems, especially during the infectious respiratory disease season in the winter. Patient risk factors during the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as during other viral outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza, are poorly characterized, consequently negatively affecting patient care. The saliva microbiome, which includes viruses and bacteria, is not currently used as in diagnostic tools. However, it may reveal risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome, and it allows for the detection and study of the viral RNA sequence for potential contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, all of which affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy. In this proposed study, Lifetime Omics will develop CLAIRE, a proof-of-concept in vivo cluster AI platform for predicting disease progression of viral infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through the analysis of the saliva metagenome. The University of Miami Medical Group Infection Control (UMMGIC) division will collaborate in this effort by collecting saliva samples from COVID-19 patients with de-identified clinical information. The samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing and Lifetime Omics will repurpose algorithms used for prediction of in vivo HIV evolution to perform genetic/phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, estimating mutation rate and immune selection pressures and identifying both the in vivo quasispecies clusters and the geographic cluster to which the patient belongs. The CLAIRE models will be trained with public datasets and tested on the metagenomic sequences generated from saliva samples of UMMGIC patients with the goal of assisting physicians in predicting disease progression in COVID-19. NARRATIVE During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for physicians admitting new patients to the hospital to distinguish patients whose disease will be mild from those who will have a severe disease progression. While this can also occur with the seasonal flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, the degree of severity seen in COVID-19, the potential of accelerated deterioration, and the high pressure on hospital resources for extended periods of time present a compelling and urgent need to better understand and anticipate the risk factors that may drive severe disease. Lifetime Omics is developing CLAIRE, a viral cluster AI system for prediction of infectious respiratory disease progression, such as COVID-19, using metagenomics and AI to provide personalized information to inform treatment decisions, help improve outcomes, and better utilize healthcare resources.",In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression,10256828,R43EB030947,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Contact Tracing', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Influenza', 'International', 'Lifting', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Infection', 'Process', 'Quarantine', 'RNA Sequences', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Ships', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'anti-viral efficacy', 'base', 'co-infection', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'health care service utilization', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'influenzavirus', 'markov model', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'negative affect', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient subsets', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'reproductive', 'saliva analysis', 'saliva sample', 'seasonal influenza', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vaccine efficacy', 'viral RNA']",NIBIB,"LIFETIME OMICS, INC.",R43,2021,248723
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,10058252,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,38571
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,10215480,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dietary control', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal condition', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,637564
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,10265645,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'urban setting']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2021,245245

In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,10128367,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'urban setting']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2021,436080
"A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations Project Abstract The number of new products such as drugs, cosmetics and food additives introduced into the market is growing and poses a significant challenge for risk prediction. Currently, vertebrate testing is the industry standard for hazard assessment but has limitations including high costs, and the growing public and corporate sentiment against using vertebrates for chemical testing. Importantly, current toxicity assessment does not incorporate genetic diversity leading to failure of drug candidates and unintended risks to human sub-populations. The celebrated invertebrate model C. elegans has the potential to fill this gap since thousands of genetically diverse nematode populations are available. However, the main challenge is that chronic studies of chemicals in the nematode model is still tedious, precluding large-scale toxicity testing in nematode populations. This proposal aims to develop a high-throughput technology for chronic toxicity screening of diverse genetic populations in adult C. elegans. The focus of our Phase I plan is to pursue chronic toxicity studies on select toxins and generate foundational data highlighting the impact of genetic diversity, and subsequently scale the NemaLife technology to enable large-scale genetic diversity screening. AIM 1: To generate chronic dose-response data on toxins affecting diverse C. elegans strains. We will test the effects of five toxins for which we know the variability in human and rodent responses. Animals will be exposed to toxins daily, followed by scoring of survival, reproductive and neuromuscular health. About 1200 whole-life assays will be conducted with data acquired on 500+ animals per assay condition. We will generate data that will define the rank-order of C. elegans toxin response vis-à-vis mammalian systems, optimize phenotyping conditions for large numbers of strains per species, and define the amount of heritable variation in toxin responses. These pilot data will validate the capabilities afforded by our screening platform. AIM 2: To scale the throughput of NemaLife Technology for thousands of chronic toxicity assays. Currently, NemaLife’s technology has a throughput of hundreds of chronic toxicity assays. However, given the large number of toxins and vast library of genetic strains and wild isolates available, there is a significant need to increase the throughput of our technology. Therefore, we will develop the technology infrastructure and workflow to scale the throughput which includes multiplexing our approach, scale-up of chip fabrication and streamlining data analysis. Technology development at the scale of thousands of whole-life toxicity assays in a few weeks with readouts on animal death and neuromuscular impairments will be a major breakthrough in the field opening up new business opportunities in toxicity testing in the drug and consumer industry. Project Narrative Non-parasitic nematodes offer a powerful in vivo model to scale and measure toxin responses in genetically diverse species anchoring a transformative means to bridge current gaps in predictive toxicology with clinically-relevant end points. Our study aims to combine state-of-the art advances in microfluidics, computer vision, laboratory automation and a massively curated genetically diverse nematode species to produce a new screening approach capable of testing thousands of chemicals relevant to agriculture, nutraceutical and biotech markets.",A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations,10112054,R43ES032516,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Cadmium', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Food Additives', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hazard Assessment', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Infrastructure', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nematoda', 'Nutraceutical', 'Paraquat', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Safety', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'genetic resource', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo Model', 'neuromuscular', 'new technology', 'reproductive', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'scale up', 'screening', 'technology development']",NIEHS,NEMALIFE INC.,R43,2021,251040
"Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures ABSTRACT The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys- tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres- sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra- tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person- alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen- tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro- gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression, and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu- rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be- tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph- eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re- search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ- ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying the alterations in the im- mune system that impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also focuses on identifying whether these altered immune profiles are influenced by sex- and age-specific factors. The development of such strategies will greatly advance the ability to develop personalized treatment approaches for persons with ALS based on immunomodulatory drugs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing the fundamental knowledge about the nervous system and using that knowledge to reduce the bur- den of neurological disease.",Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures,10177640,R01NS120926,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Estrogens', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Mediating', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,643473
"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy. Project Narrative We will study how immune system genes affect the success of transplantation for patients of diverse ancestries.

"Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion PROJECT SUMMARY Host proteins play essential roles in the replication of all viruses. This represents a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to develop interventions against viruses currently circulating in humans as well as new and emerging viral threats. However, realizing this potential requires mechanistic understanding of how specific host factors function during viral infection. This proposal will develop a versatile screening methodology to investigate the mechanisms through which host proteins enhance virus replication. This will be achieved using recent developments in genome engineering and chemical biology that enable site-specific modification of host factors with unnatural amino acids. By genetically re-coding >100 host proteins implicated in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), we will investigate (1) the effects of depleting specific host factors on virus replication and the subcellular localization of viral proteins; (2) the effects of viral infection on the expression and subcellular localization of host proteins; and (3) the effects of host factor depletion on the assembly and morphogenesis of new virus particles. If successful, this project will provide insight into the host dependency of IAV and establish a resource for investigating host protein function in the replication of additional, evolutionarily-divergent respiratory viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Therapeutic interventions that can prevent or control emerging viral infections are urgently needed. One approach to developing these interventions is to target proteins from the host that function to enhance viral infection, rather than targeting the virus directly. By contributing to a better understanding of how specific host proteins contribute to viral replication, the proposed research will accelerate the development of host-directed antiviral therapies.",Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion,10286563,R21AI163985,"['Amber', 'Amino Acids', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'CRISPR library', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemic', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Fluorescence', 'Fruit', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Terminator Codon', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Transfer RNA', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'airway epithelium', 'base', 'combat', 'genome editing', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'protein function', 'respiratory virus', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236250
"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10170244,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,213780
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2 One of the most poorly understood yet clinically important aspects of the novel COVID-19 SARS CoV2 coronavirus is the marked heterogeneity that it displays with infection severity and with development of end organ complications and mortality. SARS CoV-2 infection has a complex epidemiologic interplay with cardiovascular (CVD) and highlights this complex heterogeneity. The biology underlying this heterogeneity in CVD outcomes is poorly understood and concomitantly, clinically useful biomarkers do not currently exist to identify the highest risk patients in need of the most intense monitoring. Thus, we propose to use integrated omics and EHR data in a diverse multi-center North Carolina cohort with existing biological specimens to determine the role of inflammation, metabolism and novel molecular mechanisms, and identify biomarkers of CVD outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We propose to (1) Determine the clinical predictors of infection severity in a diverse population of individuals with CVD risk factors and SARS-CoV2 infection including evaluation of racial differences; (2) Determine the role of inflammatory, SARS-CoV-2 related, and other candidate proteins as biomarkers of infection severity and CVD outcomes in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection; and (3) Evaluate metabolic pathways in SARS Co-V-2 infection severity and CVD outcomes. The proposal has high potential for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the heterogeneity between CVD and SARS CoV-2 outcomes. Importantly, it has great short-term potential for clinically important results that will lead to earlier and better identification of high-risk patients for more intensive monitoring; novel therapeutic interventions to prevent end organ complications and mortality; and diagnostic and disease-progression biomarkers. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it is emerging that patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and pre-existing CVD appear to have a worse severity of infection. Furthermore, CVD complications appear to be relatively common in patients with COVID-19 regardless of pre-existing CVD. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will develop the most severe infection and who will develop CVD complications. Technologies have evolved such that hundreds of proteins and other markers and millions of genetic markers can be rapidly measured in small amounts of blood. Thus, in this proposal, we will use these cutting-edge technologies in blood samples collected from patients with COVID-19 from two large medical centers in North Carolina, to identify biomarkers that can tell us those patients who will have the most severe infections and those patients who have suffer CVD complications, as well as identifying the genes that may predispose patients to these complications.",Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2,10303644,R21AI158786,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Angiotensins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inpatients', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'North Carolina', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'secondary outcome', 'thrombotic']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,255940
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing. These methods will be configured into commercially available kits and testing services.",High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants,10255405,R44ES033138,"['Address', 'Animal Testing', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Canada', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'End Point Assay', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Miniaturization', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Reagent', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cell type', 'climate change', 'computerized tools', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genotoxicity', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'micronucleus', 'phosphatase inhibitor', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'testing services']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2021,204743
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",10063870,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,178370
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria continues to be responsible for substantial childhood mortality in Africa despite current control efforts. Developing an effective vaccine for malaria elimination is constrained by knowledge gaps in both naturally- acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. Existing vaccine candidates elicit antibodies against the target antigen but the associations between antibody functional activity and level and duration of protection are unknown. Additionally novel blood-stage antigens that could be used in future vaccines aimed at preventing symptomatic malaria have emerged (some are polymorphic), that need to be further investigated. Preferred antigens should elicit antibody functional activity that is: i) boosted with natural infection; ii) long-lasting; iii) correlated with protection; iv) not highly strain-specific, i.e., effective against a diversity of isolates. Our study aims to clarify these unknowns focusing on 12 understudied blood-stage antigens (and the alleles of those polymorphic antigens) to inform selection of antigens that could be potential vaccine candidates.  Prior studies of naturally-acquired antibody immunity have largely quantified antibody magnitude to specific proteins and have typically been limited to quantifying immune responses infrequently or at a single time-point. Because the immune profiles of individuals are dynamic and a function of exposure to infection that cannot be synchronized at the beginning of a study, these largely cross-sectional measurements obscure outcomes of interest. Furthermore, prior studies predominantly measured only magnitude of IgG responses; few have assessed the range and breath of functional activities of antibodies, and the impact of antigen polymorphisms on functional antibody activities.  The expertise of our study team, combined with access to samples collected during a longitudinal study with intensive follow-up and a comprehensive study approach, provides an opportunity to address these questions and elucidate the importance of these antigens in acquired immunity to malaria. Our study will be based on a cohort of children and adults who were seen monthly over two years in which subjects had repeated clinical and/or sub clinical malaria infections. Studying this cohort will enable us to gain new insights into the durability and boosting over time of functional antibody activity against blood-stage antigens upon natural exposure to malaria. We will also evaluate the cross-reactivity or strain-specificity of functional antibodies against alternative alleles of polymorphic antigens. Finally, we will evaluate antigens (and alleles) against which functional antibody activity is correlated with protection from symptomatic malaria and high density parasitemia, and we will seek signatures of functional responses that can accurately discriminate protected and unprotected subjects. These correlates of protection will provide endpoints for evaluating future vaccines. This may have implications for strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Development of an effective vaccine to combat malaria is hampered by knowledge gaps in malaria immunity. The general objective of our study is to inform selection of antigens for evaluation as potential vaccine candidates and establish approaches and principals that can be applied in future larger studies. We will use data from parasite genetics, new analytical approaches, and antibody functional activity targeting novel antigens that have promise as future vaccine candidates.",Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi,10128971,R21AI151459,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Africa', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antibody-mediated protection', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Beds', 'Blood', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health care facility', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Malawi', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Time', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'acquired immunity', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'international center', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2021,276326
"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to be a severe global health problem. TB is multifaceted, but a central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mtb to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents with potent growth inhibitory activity. This persistence in the face of immunologic and antibiotic pressure underlies several important facets of TB disease, including 1) the existence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and, in the setting of immunologic failure of LTBI control, its role in the genesis of active TB and 2) the prolonged course of TB antibiotic therapy, which requires 6 months of multidrug therapy to achieve reliable clinical cure. Rather than producing complete bacterial eradication in all treated subjects, cure following TB chemotherapy is now understood to be an antibiotic induced paucibacillary state in which prevention of relapse depends in part on poorly understood host factors. The host and bacterial determinants that mediate these two interrelated types of persistence are only partially understood, a knowledge gap the Tri-I-TBRU aims to fill. We propose a set of 3 intersecting projects and 3 cores all focused on different facets of the problem of paucibacillary TB, both post treatment and LTBI. The projects will use samples and clinical data from TB cohorts at our clinical site at GHESKIO in Port Au Prince Haiti, to examine the immunologic, microbiomic, transcriptomic, pharmacokinetic, and genetic factors that influence or predict the transition points between paucibacillary states of TB disease and active transmissible infection. These human studies will be compared and contrasted with a new mouse model of paucibacillary infection that will allow us to test mechanistic hypotheses about the host and bacterial determinants of paucibacillary disease. This work with be conducted by a team of highly collaborative investigators who have who have worked well together for several years. Tuberculosis is a major global health burden, killing more than 1.5 million people every year, despite the availability of therapy. A central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents. This project will investigate the host and bacterial determinants that mediate persistence of Mtb within its human host.","Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection",10268801,U19AI162568,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Bacillus', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Fluids', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Country', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haiti', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Ships', 'Siblings', 'Sterilization', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'chronic infection', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'immunopathology', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'mouse model', 'next generation sequencing', 'pathogen', 'pressure', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis chemotherapy', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U19,2021,2755450
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines,10086740,U01AI155354,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Aotus primate', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Geographic Locations', 'Germany', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Interferons', 'Interleukin-12', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Liver', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Organ', 'Parasites', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Safety', 'Seminal', 'Serum', 'Spleen', 'Sporozoite vaccine', 'Sporozoites', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'asexual', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'cost', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'lymph nodes', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'protective efficacy', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'volunteer']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",U01,2021,942943
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,10097958,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2021,185224
"Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using Serology Enteric pathogen infections are a leading cause of the global disease burden, with the largest burden among children in low-resource settings. Stool-based PCR methods have dramatically improved our ability to measure enteric infections, but the challenge of collecting stool and need for near-continuous monitoring to detect many globally important pathogens has thwarted broader use in large-scale surveillance. Large-scale, population- based surveys now regularly collect blood to monitor transmission and burden of diseases such as HIV, malaria and dengue. Broader testing of blood collected in such surveys with multiplex assays represents a new opportunity to measure enteric pathogen transmission and burden. Antibody-based measures could complement stool-based PCR testing because antibody responses remain elevated for many months after infection, thus providing more information in studies with infrequent measurements. Our team has developed multiplex bead assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to diverse enteric pathogens. In preliminary studies we have shown that IgG levels can be used to measure heterogeneity in enteric pathogen transmission between populations. We have also shown the results generalize to pathogens that span taxa. In this application, we propose to complete a series of studies that address key next steps to advance the seroepidemiology of enteric pathogens in low-resource settings. We will conduct a longitudinal birth cohort in Ecuador that pairs high resolution, multiplex stool-based PCR infection with longitudinal, multiplex IgG and IgA measurements. Our 17- year research history at the site has documented substantial variation in enteric pathogen infection across a rural-urban gradient, making it an ideal setting for the research. The cohort will enroll 600 children from three sites across a rural-urban gradient, and measure them frequently from birth to 24 months. On the Luminex platform, we will pair multiplex PCR assessment for 15 enteric pathogens with IgG and IgA assessment in a multiplex bead assay that includes antigens to 7 enteric pathogens: Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and norovirus. In Aim 1, we will use molecular and antibody-based measures to study force of infection of the enteric pathogens across a rural-urban gradient. This will represent the first broad-based comparison of seroepidemiologic measures against patent infection for enterics. In Aim 2, we will estimate enteric pathogen force of infection by applying current-status models to population-based, cross-sectional serology surveys in the region, and will benchmark the cross-sectional estimates against those obtained in the concurrent longitudinal study. In Aim 3, we will study IgG and IgA kinetics following infection for each of the 7 pathogens, and develop models to accurately predict recent infections and incidence from antibody levels measured in cross-sectional serology surveys. Completion of these aims will result in generalizable seroepidemiologic methods that have the potential to transform measurement of enteric pathogen transmission and burden in low-resource settings. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Pathogens that cause diarrheal disease account for an immense global public health burden, primarily among young children in low-resource settings. The use of antibodies to study the epidemiology of diarrhea-causing pathogens has potential to improve our measurement of pathogen transmission in research and surveillance. This project will advance the epidemiologic methods used to measure diarrhea-causing pathogen exposure at the population level, by completing the first comprehensive study that pairs antibody-based and stool-based measures of infection among a birth cohort living across a rural-urban gradient in Ecuador.",Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using Serology,10277352,R01AI162867,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Arboviruses', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Campylobacter jejuni', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross Infection', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Dengue', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Ecuador', 'Enrollment', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Language', 'Legal patent', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Newborn Infant', 'Norovirus', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Salmonella enterica', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'antibody detection', 'antibody test', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'diarrheal disease', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'population based', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'serosurveillance', 'serosurvey', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'urban area']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,781015
"Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation ABSTRACT During the first 3 years of life (YOL) the infant gut microbiome (GM) rapidly diversifies both in structure and function, concomitant with dietary and environmental transitions. Critically, the GM response to specific external stimuli is patient-specific, complicating individualized risk predictions. Healthy GM maturation includes accruing multiple strains of the same species, which frequently differ in key functions. These functional differences, ac- centuated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations, could resolve conflicting associations of the same species with both health and disease. The rationale behind our proposal is that strain- and species- level variation in bacterial functions drives heterogenous GM responses to early-life (EL) dietary and antibiotic perturbations, which explains, in part, individualized developmental trajectories. This proposal pursues two highly complementary Aims: 1) Define strain-resolved functional maturation of the pediatric gut microbiome and 2) Investigate the acute effects of EL antibiotic (ELA) perturbation on strain dynamics, HGT, and micro- biome maturation in preterm neonates and microbiota-humanized mice. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that EL environmental exposures shape genomic diversification of gut species, causing lasting changes in GM com- munity structure and microbial functions. We will leverage our unique set of 2,436 stools collected over the first 9 YOL from infants variably exposed to dietary and environmental stimuli. By combining culture-enriched meta- genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we will determine taxa-function relationships at the sub-spe- cies level and power statistical models that predict the impact of EL exposures on strain diversification, microbe- function associations, and transcriptional activity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELAs acutely alter strain dynamics and stimulate HGT and that the GM response to ELA can be predicted from baseline composition and function. Here, we will interrogate 160 stools flanking variable ELA exposure in 80 preterm neonates in the first 4 months of life, combining culture-enriched metagenomics with selective culture and isolate sequencing to char- acterize the preterm `plasmidome' and profile post-ELA strain dynamics and HGT. To identify microbiome-intrin- sic responses to ELA, we will utilize an innovative transgenerational mouse model where germ-free dams receive human, preterm, microbiota that is vertically transferred to their pups, which are treated with parenteral antibiot- ics. We will use the resulting data to predict individual GM responses to specific antibiotics based on composition, resistance gene content, and bacterial functions. Our proposal is innovative because our interdisciplinary re- search team will characterize strain-level bacterial functions to understand the heterogeneity of GM responses to EL perturbations on two pre-existing sets of human specimens; it is significant because it will identify features that predict species-resolved GM-specific responses to EL selection. Our work will advance pediatric microbi- ome research by comprehensively characterizing strain-resolved functional maturation and GM disruption to understand individual variation leading towards a future of personalized, microbiome medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study addresses our gap in understanding how the early life human gut microbiome responds to diet and antibiotics, including impacts on functional maturation and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance. This research is relevant for public health because it will improve our understanding of the effects of antibiotics and diet on microbiome dynamics beyond the coarse level of microbial communities and establish predictive models for future personalized antibiotic treatment and dietary recommendations that minimize collateral damage and maximize development of the healthy infant microbiome. By complementing data from two unique human cohorts with hypothesis testing in a mouse model this project is relevant to the NIH's mission of leveraging basic research in mechanisms of health and disease to improve outcomes in treatment and maintenance of human health.",Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation,10298201,R01AI155893,"['9 year old', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Birth', 'Carbohydrates', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Patients', 'Plasmids', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Salvelinus', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vitamins', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'amino acid metabolism', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'cohort', 'de novo mutation', 'dietary', 'early life exposure', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'infant gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preterm newborn', 'pup', 'repository', 'resistance gene', 'response', 'risk prediction']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,756349
"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Behavior', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermis', 'Development', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hair follicle structure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hydrogels', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Papillary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surface', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transposase', 'United States', 'Verteporfin', 'Visual', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'functional loss', 'healing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skin regeneration', 'skin wound', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'wound', 'wound bed', 'wound environment', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026
"Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY Every year in this country 40,000 patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal disease caused by excessive extracellular matrix production by myofibroblasts in distributed lesions, or “fibrotic foci”, throughout the lung. Despite the availability of two FDA-approved drugs that are considered standard of care, the mortality rate for IPF patients exceeds 30% at four years, and there are no drugs that halt disease progression, making diagnosis with IPF a death sentence for over 500,000 Americans living with this disease. Identifying the cells of origin that give rise to myofibroblasts is necessary for finding treatments that can halt or cure IPF. Based on experimental data and computational simulations from our research team, we hypothesize that myofibroblasts arise from microvascular pericytes (cells that normally enwrap capillaries) when heterotypic pericyte-endothelial interactions become disrupted. We further posit that strategic modulation of kinase-mediated signaling in pericytes can prevent pericyte-to-myofibroblast transitions and halt the progression of IPF. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments to study pericyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation and to investigate how microvessel adaptations in the lung contribute to IPF. Specifically, we will develop a new agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates logic-based intracellular signaling networks to simulate cell behaviors and leverages Bayesian inference for rule refinement (Aim 1), validate the ABM's ability to predict pericyte phenotype transitions and the emergence of fibrotic foci in response to drugs using the murine bleomycin model of IPF (Aim 2), and bridge murine experiments with clinical data in order to predict how druggable kinase-driven signaling pathways affect IPF progression via modulation of pericytes and microvessels (Aim 3). To our knowledge, our proposed studies will be the first to combine computational modeling with experiments to study microvascular contributors to IPF progression. In addition to producing a new computational model that is validated for bridging pre-clinical study results to clinical outcomes, we expect to identify new therapeutic approaches for IPF that target microvascular cells, previously underexplored but potentially critical contributors to this deadly disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly disease caused by uncontrolled tissue fibrosis in the lungs. There are no FDA-approved drugs that cure or prevent disease progression. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments study how fibroblasts and microvessel remodeling in the lung contribute to disease and to identify novel drugs and drug combinations that target these processes in order to effectively treat IPF.",Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis,10305193,R01HL155143,"['Affect', 'Alveolar', 'American', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Bleomycin', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FDA approved', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Harvest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Myofibroblast', 'Nature', 'New Agents', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pirfenidone', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tamoxifen', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'To specify', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'pulmonary agents', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'skeletal', 'standard of care', 'therapy design', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,548214
"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Abstract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by overproduction of mucus in the lungs followed by chronic lung infections. Conventional wisdom has been that most CF lung infections involve a single dominant organism, most commonly the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Advances in culture-independent techniques have revealed that CF lung infections are rarely mono-microbial and instead usually involve complex microbial communities, yet the interspecies interactions that drive these communities are poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that polymicrobial infections are more difficult than mono-microbial infections to eradicate with antibiotics, leading to the concept of recalcitrant communities. The mechanisms underlying recalcitrance are thought to involve synergistic interactions between community members, but very little data are available to understand this phenomenon. Combined with the realization that many CF patients respond poorly to available antibiotic regimens compels a more detailed understanding of interspecies interactions and their impacts on antibiotic recalcitrance to improve the treatment of CF infections, as well as other polymicrobial diseases. Here, we combine big-data bioinformatics, in silico computational modeling and in vitro culture experiments to gain insights into the metabolic interactions that drive CF disease outcomes and antibiotic recalcitrance. The research will leverage an available data set of hundreds of CF patient samples that provide both bacterial composition data and clinical metadata, including measures of lung function. These samples will be clustered according to their measured compositions and metabolic capabilities predicted through computational metabolic modeling to test the hypothesis that the vast complexity of these many bacterial communities can be collapsed into a small number of model communities that capture most of the observed metabolic variability. These computational predictions will be tested by developing in vitro cell culture models that recapitulate the most important metabolic features of the in vivo polymicrobial communities (Aim 1). By applying bioinformatics and modeling to the same clinical data, we will test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive disease outcomes and the virulence potential of these communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will interrogate the clinical data and in vitro communities to test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive antibiotic recalcitrance and differentiate community responsiveness to antibiotics according to these metabolic features (Aim 3). Our research will yield novel insights into how complex polymicrobial communities are compositionally structured, interact metabolically, contribute to disease and respond to antibiotics. Moreover, the research will validate in vitro models that offer the potential for development of novel antimicrobial strategies to better treat chronic, polymicrobial infections in CF and other diseases. Our transdisciplinary team offers the necessary expertise in bioinformatics, computational modeling, microbial physiology and CF polymicrobial infections to tackle this complex problem. Project Narrative: Infections associated with cystic fibrosis, and other polymicrobial infections, are still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

"Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently over 7.4 million people in the US have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 and over 215,000 have died. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, which disproportionally affects elderly patients. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 triggers such severe pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recent clinical studies have suggested that cell death, especially the induction of necroptosis, may be predictor of severe COVID-19 disease. The mechanism by which the host restricts necroptosis is unclear. In the preliminary data we have shown that the interferon induced protein, ISG15, acts as a negative regulator of necroptosis and its downstream inflammatory responses during viral infection. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 induces necroptosis and that ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells. We will use in vitro primary tracheal epithelial cultures (hTECs) and an in vivo mouse adapted SARS-CoV2 animal model to ask several questions including: 1) Does SARS- CoV2 induce necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells; 2) Does ISG15 modulate necroptotic cell death as well as proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in respiratory epithelial cells during SARS-CoV2 infection?; 3) Does necroptosis and its regulation by ISG15 contribute to SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis? Overall, our studies will provide important insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection and provide potential insight into mechanisms underlying severe disease, which may direct efforts toward the development of diagnostic markers and future countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear why certain populations, particularly the elderly, are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of this work is to determine whether excessive inflammatory cell death, regulated by ISG15 and RIPK3, acts as a key factor in severe COVID-19 disease.",Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection,10287787,R21AI163822,"['2019-nCoV', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Avian Influenza', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'CRISPR screen', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HMGB1 Protein', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'ISG15 gene', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory Response Pathway', 'Interferons', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'RIPK3 gene', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Source', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Tropism', 'Ubiquitin Like Proteins', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viral Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'genome-wide', 'high risk population', 'human coronavirus', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'severe COVID-19', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196875
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,10190807,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'sample archive', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,191195
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,10159971,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,516181
"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,10176257,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,644656
"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review.

"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,10159730,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,689648
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not.

"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals,10289637,R21AI164268,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Epidemiologist', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Feces', 'Filovirus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune response', 'Immunological Models', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Mammals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muridae', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paramyxovirus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral reservoir', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics resource', 'data reuse', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prevent', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'surveillance study', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2021,244519
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNF therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNF therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNF responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNF responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNF therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNF treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,10017215,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Restriction-Modification Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,638466
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,10300376,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,K01,2021,108000
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data repository', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time Summary/Abstract Approximately 150 million people annually experience urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common cause of which is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The gut is a known reservoir of UPEC, which typically reside at low abundance, but can transcend the periurethral area to invade the bladder. While the E. coli population within the gut can be diverse, it has been suggested that certain strains have a greater propensity to migrate and cause infection. This may be one driving factor to explain why half of those with an acute infection have a recurrence even after taking antibiotics that clear the first infection from the urinary tract. Being able to detect and track E. coli strains over time would have direct clinical applications for those patients who have frequent recurrences due to gut UPEC carriage. One such clinical application would be early detection and intervention before the onset of infection. Unfortunately, current metagenomic algorithms are not capable of performing strain tracking accurately enough for clinical relevance, especially for low abundance species such as E. coli. A major factor for this lack of accuracy is that all current state-of-the-art metagenomic tools completely ignore temporal dependence between samples. Even if it is known that multiple samples are from the same patient, current tools analyze those samples as if they were independent. Furthermore, many metagenomic tools ignore the sequence quality information that is provided for every nucleobase in every read. We propose to develop a more precise strain tracking algorithm that does take this additional information into account, making the tool host-time-quality aware. Finally, we will pilot and validate our algorithm on a clinically relevant gnotobiotic colonization model. Specifically, humanized germ-free mice will be undergoing two rounds of E. coli challenges with therapeutic perturbations from antibiotics or mannosides, a small molecule precision antibiotic-sparing therapeutic. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Develop the first purpose-built computational method for tracking bacterial strains in the microbiome over time, (2) Gnotobiotic mouse model undergoing UPEC challenges and a therapeutic perturbation. These aims would advance the microbiome field forward allowing for the future development of therapeutics and clinical diagnostics. Narrative Pathogens often reside in the gut at low abundance, hindering our ability to detect them and obfuscating their pathogenesis. To overcome this challenge, we propose to develop high-quality and high-resolution tools for tracking bacterial strains over time. These tools will further our scientific understanding surrounding bacterial infections and ultimately aid in the development of new therapeutics.",Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time,10218776,R21AI154075,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Bladder', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Invaded', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannosides', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Uropathogenic E. coli', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'de novo mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome therapeutics', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleobase', 'pathogen', 'recurrent infection', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'time use', 'tool']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,268500
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'former smoker', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10140254,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,202259

"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Such knowledge may lead to improved identification of patient subgroups for development of novel and targeted therapies in HNSCC.",Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC,10184419,R01DE030493,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dissection', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune signaling', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Domains', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tobacco use', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Markers', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'conventional therapy', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'genome wide screen', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenic', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment', 'tertiary lymphoid organ', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIDCR,H.

"Blocking CMV transmission through the human milk metabolome and microbiome Despite decades-long research and multiple trials, there is no licensed vaccine against Cytomegalovirus (CMV) yet, urging efforts to better understand its transmission dynamics. CMV is a frequent cause of tissue-invasive disease in infants and immunocompromised individuals, and transmission happens easily and through contact with various body fluids. Among transmission modes, CMV transmission via human milk (HM) is recognized to have the largest global impact on population prevalence. Factors determining CMV transmission remain largely unknown, including CMV interactions with HM microbiota and metabolites. In general, commensal microbiota can greatly impact sensitivity to viral infections while, metabolites, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), not only feed human microbiota but can also act as soluble decoy receptors, blocking the attachment of viral pathogens to epithelial cells. Additionally, short chain and medium chain fatty acids are products of microbial fermentation, known to influence immune responses, and microbiota can also produce antivirals through secondary metabolism. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to better define CMV transmission dynamics, considering different factors and timescales, and to systematically and quantitatively study the role and interactions of the HM metabolome and microbiome influencing CMV transmission from women to their infants. Our preliminary data readily shows that CMV seronegative and seropositive mothers have distinct HM microbiome and metabolome ecologies. In particular, we found clear differences distinguishing seropositive mothers that are non-shedding, shedding but not transmitting, and shedding and transmitting CMV. These results led to the central hypothesis, which is that certain combinations of HM microbiota and metabolites prevent CMV transmissions, and that these combinations vary among individual dyads, but follow traceable and reproducible patterns. We propose to test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Determine CMV transmission dynamics with high sample density and HM microbiome ecologies underlying CMV transmission versus non-transmission; (2) Identify and validate key metabolites involved in CMV transmission and non-transmission; and (3) Define causality and identify molecular mechanisms of CMV transmission inhibition assisted by mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence. Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by elucidating CMV-host interactions and CMV transmission dynamics in various time scales, validating factors blocking CMV transmission, and providing models and tools to help advance the arrival of clinical resource. These studies also have the potential to lay the groundwork for, and translate into, rational design of personalized HM and microbiome-metabolome interventions without replacing HM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed interdisciplinary research is relevant to public health because Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe illness in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. Transmission via human milk (HM) has been recognized to have the largest global impact on population prevalence and, therefore, a research program will be undertaken to study HM CMV transmission dynamics in different timescales, systematically and quantitatively understand the role and interactions of the HM metabolome and microbiome in CMV transmission from women to their infants, validate factors blocking CMV transmission, and evaluate the impact of CMV transmission to the establishment and development of infant gut microbiota. Our findings will deepen our understanding of CMV transmission dynamics, provide a framework for translation assisted by mathematical models and artificial intelligence, and will lay the foundation for rational design of personalized interventions through naturally occurring HM microbiota and metabolites.",Blocking CMV transmission through the human milk metabolome and microbiome,10211940,R01HD102690,"['Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bile Acids', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Fluids', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Communities', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fermentation', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infection prevention', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medium chain fatty acid', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Passive Immunization', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Supplementation', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Shedding', 'Woman', 'base', 'blocking factor', 'blood group', 'cofactor', 'commensal microbes', 'comparative', 'congenital infection', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'gut microbiota', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'milk microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'non-genetic', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'seropositive', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,648545
"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,10083187,R21AR074685,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Arthritis', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee Injuries', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'joint destruction', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,160567
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort. The successful outcome of this study will aid physicians in identifying patients for targeted therapies.",Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM,10124429,R01HL150023,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'pulmonary function decline', 'regional difference', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,686225
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10183157,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'detection limit', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'rapid test', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,659282
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types).

"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics. We propose to use multiple types of biologic data to identify different COPD subtypes, which may be important for disease prognosis and treatment.",Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,10205150,K08HL136928,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Expert Opinion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'SNP array', 'Severities', 'Spirometry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'machine learning method', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,172800
"Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare, autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi- omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.  To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply- phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome” using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim 3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC- associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will conduct the first multi-omics translational study of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), to improve understanding of the culprits driving this rare, autoimmune liver disease. By integrating multiple layers of omics data, we will better define the architecture of cellular networks driving PBC. In so doing, we will identify molecular signatures including immune alterations, environmental toxins, and metabolism-related chemicals unique to PBC patients, thereby spurring improved understanding of PBC pathobiology and identification of novel druggable targets.",Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis,10095117,R01DK126691,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary biliary cirrhosis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell free DNA', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'effective therapy', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'quantum', 'response', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,628683
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873
"Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome PROJECT SUMMARY Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome Hippocrates said ~2,400 years ago: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. It is now well known that this is largely due to the “diet-microbiota-host” interactions that happen in the human gut. In particular, microbial degradation of carbohydrates can produce a variety of metabolites, which have a profound impact on human health. As a bioinformatics researcher in the Nebraska Food for Health Center, the long-term interests of the PI include: (i) develop specialized computational tools for better functional annotation of food-digesting microbial genomes and metagenomes, and (ii) characterize enzymes and other genetic elements that connect microbes, diets, and human health. The objective of this R01 project is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools for functional annotation of carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) and CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in human gut microbiome. The PI has over 10 years of experience in CAZyme bioinformatics tool development, and maintains a well-recognized CAZyme annotation database and web server called dbCAN (http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2). This project aims to further dbCAN development to address fundamental personalized nutrition questions: (i) is a gut microbe able to utilize a specific type of glycan? (ii) can a person carrying certain gut microbes respond to an individualized diet (e.g., prebiotics: dietary compounds that are beneficial to human health)? To address these questions, new CAZyme annotation tools must have the ability to predict the carbohydrate substrates of CAZymes. Recent research has found that different CAZyme encoding genes are often co-localized with each other and with other genes (e.g., those encoding sugar transporters, regulators, and signaling proteins) in bacterial genomes to form CGCs (also known as polysaccharide utilization loci or PULs). Thus, the foundation of the new tool development is that the gene membership (or functional domain composition) of a CGC can be used to predict its carbohydrate substrates (e.g., xylans, pectins, glucans, etc.). The innovation is that machine learning approaches will be used to analyze a large number of experimentally characterized PULs curated from literature, and the extracted sequence features will be used to build effective classifiers to predict and classify CGCs in new genomes/metagenomes. The expected outcome will be novel and user-friendly open source computer programs, databases, and web servers that allow automated CGCs identification and substrate predictions. The significance is that the new tools will facilitate the experimental characterization of more PULs and their carbohydrate substrates in human gut microbiome (also in other carbohydrate rich environments). Therefore, this project will contribute computational solutions to the research of personalized nutrition, e.g., analyze a person's gut microbiome to predict if this person can respond to diets containing certain prebiotic glycans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human gut microbes primarily feed on carbohydrate substrates derived from diet and host, and produce important metabolites that significantly influence host physiology and health. The functional annotation of the carbohydrate metabolic enzyme repertoire of gut microbes is poorly defined for most bacterial phyla, resulting in gaps in understanding of how microbial communities utilize these carbohydrates to influence human health. Creating new bioinformatics tools for predicting carbohydrate utilization will contribute to the arising microbiome-based personalized nutrition practice and aid in the development of therapeutic options to prevent/treat human metabolic disorders.",Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome,10099567,R01GM140370,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroidetes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Carbohydrates', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Firmicutes', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucans', 'Glycosides', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannans', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microbe', 'Nebraska', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pectins', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Polysaccharides', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Starch', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xylans', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dietary', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'metagenome', 'metatranscriptome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'microbiome sequencing', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'prebiotics', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'web server']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R01,2021,302120
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19,10273964,R61HD105618,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'BLase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 assay', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'California', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'FDA Emergency Use Authorization', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'RADx', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'cell free DNA', 'clinical assay development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'genetic pedigree', 'nasal swab', 'novel strategies', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2021,863810
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10211103,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing Alternatives', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Baculoviruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Economic Burden', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Ferrets', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Ha antigen', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Insecta', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recombinants', 'Seasons', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Serology test', 'Severities', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Spanish flu', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Antigens', 'Switzerland', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Translations', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Antigens', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiviral immunity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'flu', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'infection rate', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'mutant', 'neutralizing antibody', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,"BIOLOGICAL MIMETICS, INC.",R43,2021,299218
"Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, pulmonary influenza infection occurs annually in 5-20% of the population with mortality in the range of 30,000 deaths. The recent 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic illustrated the potential for higher infection rates, which were reported to be as high as 45% in certain age groups. The 2017-18 influenza season had the highest pediatric mortalities since the 2009 pandemic. Influenza infection is known to result in a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes in humans, although severe pneumonia is relatively rare. Despite this, severe disease often requires advanced supportive care in the young, including previously healthy children. Host factors involved in determining the outcome of influenza infection are unclear and children are known to be at higher risk of severe disease. First life exposure to influenza is also thought to dictate life-long immunity. Little is known about the effects of young age and gender on influenza responses and severity. This underscores the importance of understanding influenza pathogenesis in a pediatric population. Influenza pathogenesis is likely mediated in large part by exuberant inflammatory host responses in the lung. It is likely that predictive soluble inflammatory mediators are present in severe infection. Further, predictive biomarkers or mathematical models of influenza pneumonia severity would enhance clinical decision making and patient care. We propose that machine learning and mathematical modeling of host immune endpoints will define a molecular fingerprint of severe influenza pneumonia in juveniles. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characteristic molecular pathways related to influenza severity in juvenile animals, using outbred mice. We will utilize machine learning and new mathematical approaches for pathway and biomarker selection. Aim 2 will test mathematical models of influenza pathogenesis to elucidate new mechanisms that drive lung injury. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify novel biomarkers and mechanistic models of influenza pneumonia severity that can be applied to children. To accomplish this we will use a broad, exploratory, and unbiased approach. Candidate biomarkers and pathways would then be evaluated in future mechanistic and translational studies in mice and humans. NARRATIVE  Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. There is a critical clinical need for biomarkers and models that predict influenza pneumonia severity in children. The goal of this study is to address this unmet need using an outbred mouse model of pediatric influenza pneumonia and well established mathematical approaches to inform future translational studies in children.",Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice,10143642,R21AI153882,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cytokine Receptors', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Seasons', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker selection', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disease phenotype', 'high risk', 'immunopathology', 'infection rate', 'influenza infection', 'influenza pneumonia', 'juvenile animal', 'lung injury', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,228212
