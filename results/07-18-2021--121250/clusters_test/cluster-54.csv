"Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. We will produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC). Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants. We propose to develop computational tools to systematically identify the core TF regulators using DNA sequence based machine learning (ML) in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and to produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC).",Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data,10238262,U01HG009380,"['Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Enhancers', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'blind', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'programs']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,572256
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173
"Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing PROJECT SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental cellular process that regulates 95% of multi-exon genes to diversify protein output and define cell-type specific functions. Both constitutive splicing and AS are controlled by combinations of cis-acting pre-messenger RNA sequences (pre-mRNA) and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Therefore, defects in splicing regulatory RNA sequence or RBPs can be highly disruptive to basic cellular activities and often lead to disease, especially neurological and muscular disorders and cancer. While the constitutive splicing code is well established, the AS code is more complicated and, thus, poorly understood. This proposal integrates multiple cutting-edge approaches to take an RBP-centric view of AS to study both cis genetic variants and trans RBP expression effects on RBP binding and splicing outcome. While thousands of non-coding genetic variants are associated with splicing variation, and are thus termed putative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), the causal variants and their molecular effects, such as RBP binding, are largely unclear. Aim 1 will address this gap by integrating RBP-focused experiments, allele-specific genomics, and state- of-the-art machine learning predictive models to characterize an important category of functional, cis non-coding variants that alter RBP binding. Importantly, I will take a unique approach to include these allele-specific RBP binding data as additional training data for our Convolutional Neural Net model. Model output is expected to much more accurately predict functional RBP binding effects of even a single nucleotide change in sequence, enabling improved interpretation of sQTLs. In addition to genetic variant effects, changes in RBP expression can have amplified downstream effects on RNA splicing. Interestingly, ~86% of RBP genes can be expressed as more than one splice isoform, but most studies to date have ignored RBP isoform-specific abundance and function. Aim 2 will provide foundational experiments to understand differential RBP isoform effects by using a novel approach to knockdown RBP isoforms by targeting Cas13 to unique exon junctions. Data from downstream assays that assess changes in RBP binding, splicing, and RNA localization will be integrated to construct the most comprehensive RBP regulatory networks to date. Results from both aims are essential to mechanistically link RNA sequence and RBP binding to splicing outcome and, ultimately, to phenotype and disease. My long-term goal is to become a principal investigator, where I will continue to leverage molecular biology, machine learning, and statistical genetics to answer unique questions about RNA-mediated associations between non-coding sequence and cellular and disease phenotype. The research and training plans proposed here are strategically tailored to provide ample opportunities to learn and apply machine learning and statistical genetics methods that complement my former PhD training in molecular biology and genomics. My sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborators at the NYGC are committed to providing the scientific expertise, computational training, and career development mentoring to ensure the successful achievement of my goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Splicing is one of the earliest RNA processing events that regulates nearly every gene in every cell, thereby driving cell-type diversity and function. Mis-regulation at the level of splicing due to genetic variants in RNA sequence or defects in regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly disruptive to basic molecular processes and often lead to disease. This proposal aims to mechanistically link genetic variants and RBP effects to splicing outcome to improve interpretation of consortia-level DNA and RNA sequencing data as it relates to phenotypic traits and disease.",Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing,10234638,F32GM142213,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Myopathy', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'convolutional neural network', 'differential expression', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'molecular phenotype', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'nuclease', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,F32,2021,65994
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.
