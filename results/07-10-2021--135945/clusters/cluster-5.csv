"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation. The goal of this project is to evaluate the benefits and harm associated with consumer-driven atrial fibrillation detection.",Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection,9980996,R03HL148372,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Apple', 'Apple watch', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Countershock', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Series', 'Sinus', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Visit', 'base', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'population based', 'routine screening', 'self diagnosis', 'smart watch', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,228951281,0.01745413638288057
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9931317,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2020,81000,558628098,-0.039657547864770056
"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare. Project Narrative. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will prepare the candidate to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI researcher pursing a research program on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic information.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9949693,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2020,131517,164685352,0.012715012191457374
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals. The data will support FDA’s commitment to promoting antimicrobial stewardship.",Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices,10166402,U01FD007057,[' '],FDA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U01,2020,199999,32532200,-0.0018935554318895147
"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,225000,0.018906443775937073
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.

"Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder The current opioid crisis is significantly impacting millions of lives, healthcare, social welfare, and the economy. Patient interactions with the treatment system coupled with results of completed studies create a wealth of data stored in disparate electronic sources. Therapists and health care providers with limited time and resources face challenges to access, integrate and monitor this vast data set for novel opportunities to improve care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.  Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching, tagging, and extracting data from database sources, the innovative platform will close the loop on actionable results by recommending updated care options based on potential outcomes learned from best practices in existing literature. The AI architecture developed will greatly improve success rates in opioid addition programs and expand high quality healthcare.  While the commercialized Survive-OUD platform will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation. The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.","Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder",10133357,R43DA052916,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Welfare', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Update', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'retention rate', 'socioeconomics', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"INSILICA, LLC",R43,2020,251348,251348,0.011690131567801533
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,260660,-0.001927342321982056
"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10038963,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,284481,415711940,-0.000211192840551012
"Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction Project Summary:  We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a mobile health software system for clinicians to conveniently and/or remotely manage and quantitatively document the healing process of chronic ulcers such as diabetic foot ulcers. Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.  Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.  Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care. All of these validates the urgent need of an alternative, convenient, and low cost clinical practice as what our mobile health app is able to provide. Project Narrative  The proposed mobile health software system to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and treatment tool, empowering them to provide personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers. With its unique client-server framework and many advantages over existing standard of care, the proposed management system will have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry. Lastly, the proprietary mobile health technology can be used for the treatment of other type of wounds and diseases such as burns, acute wounds, battle wounds, and endoscopic diseases.",Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction,10081799,R44AG067799,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Burn injury', 'Chronic Care', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Information Management', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stasis Ulcer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Visit', 'Visual Perception', 'Wound models', 'acute wound', 'augmented intelligence', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'care coordination', 'checkup examination', 'chronic ulcer', 'chronic wound', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data management', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'dimensional analysis', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'healing', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 designs', 'programs', 'routine care', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIA,"XYKEN, LLC",R44,2020,298277,1222729,0.01709518288645106
"Administrative Supplement to Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual's independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer's disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual's quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence.

"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,111231681,-0.0345866210159811
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Assisted living communities- transforming predictive data into proactive care for COVID-19 ABSTRACT Recent data suggests that that older Americans who contact COVID-19 are at greatest risk for hospitalization and poor outcomes. Additionally, due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for developing COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Since the identification of first US case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, several outbreaks have been identified in long-term care and assisted living facilities with evidence of rapid spread. Older residents and the staff of long-term care assisted living facilities as well as public health officials are facing a multitude of challenges which render early detection of COVID-19 infections difficult in these facilities and which have posed a major barrier to the efforts to control the spread of infection. Adding to these challenges, more than half of residents with positive COVID-19 test results are asymptomatic at the time of testing, further contributing to transmission. There is an urgent unmet need for strategies for monitoring of residents in long-term care and assisted living facilities to facilitate early detection of the infection using means that require minimal person-to-person contact. While the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread is being addressed by several contact tracing apps, assessing the risk for development of severe symptoms and hospitalization in these community residents requires active physiological monitoring and ecological momentary assessment in the context of preexisting clinical conditions and presents an immediate unmet need. With this project, we propose to deliver a user- friendly COVID-19 early detection alert platform (COVID-Alert) that integrates: 1) biosensor ensemble that noninvasively and continuously monitor and record critical vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and activity level); 2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using the 5-question set released by CDC and adopted across US by healthcare providers and health insurance industry; 3) artificial intelligence framework that triggers an alert based on synthesis of real-time physiological biosensing data feed, EMA monitoring of symptoms, with personalized risk profiles of preexisting conditions derived from electronic health record maintained by the facility. COVID-19 clinical decision support integrated into the workflow of long-term care facilities will ensure that residents receive appropriate and timely care (resident level) and ongoing surveillance to prevent an outbreak (facility level) while avoiding unnecessary staff exposure. This study brings together a strong interdisciplinary team of experts in engineering, informatics, data science, machine learning, and CDS. The advanced data-driven predictive model will be trained and validated using both high-dimensional EHR data and clinician feedback. The process of the algorithm development and clinical implementation will be closely monitored and evaluated through formative and summative evaluation. NARRATIVE Due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for hospitalization from COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Our team will develop and perform formative and summative evaluation of a COVID-19 early detection/hospitalization risk prediction platform, which will provide actionable clinical decision support.

"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records.

"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",9932165,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2020,443454,1632894,0.010630827685127802
"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Bluetooth', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Wireless Technology', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'innovation', 'left ventricular assist device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'ventricular assist device', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,913319,0.006250499227792717
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,903546,0.0062912914312389994
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use.

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Expenditures', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Printing', 'Private Sector', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,7144125,-0.013818875474533174
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9869048,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,595773,558628098,-0.005617604107782474
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,41751724,-0.028951956759634394
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9930157,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,644350,533594881,0.01812577990108992
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10091300,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,650000,111231681,-0.01932028300396055
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,10001603,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,654816,1405065,-0.03786697045541133
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,10187768,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,656378,241268189,0.009752609624022374
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9912846,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,761406,570146095,-0.011517486222541604
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,168440418,-0.0055834735159892256
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,377931988,0.007045562352658394
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,415711940,-0.026659003188286578
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9890992,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,986375,367414121,-0.053837200122817216
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,232986943,-0.009988281460930436
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9990638,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'randomized controlled design', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2020,1744950,7626610,0.03087640324004537
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,1992588,-0.06135448925465671
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9616227,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2019,73946,324592664,-0.010717195696710176
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback.

"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'injured', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,558628098,-0.039657547864770056
"The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment Project Summary We propose to examine the effectiveness of an early childhood home visiting program to reduce child maltreatment after dissemination to at-risk mothers in Connecticut, through analysis of administrative data. Child maltreatment has life-long impacts on children and is difficult to prevent, but there is evidence that home visiting can reduce maltreatment in the research setting. The effectiveness of home visiting in decreasing child maltreatment after dissemination to community settings is not well established. One challenge in evaluating maltreatment accurately is surveillance bias, which is the increased chance of a report that a family in the home visiting program has, compared to if they were not in the program. These extra reports are hypothesized to be for less severe situations. One way to assess maltreatment that avoids surveillance bias is to examine medical care for injuries, which can be considered a proxy measure for child maltreatment. Although many injuries are accidental, if one group has more injuries than another, this may be evidence that they either have a less safe environment (potential neglect) or have been physically abused. In Connecticut, approximately 40% of first-time mothers are screened for maltreatment risk each year for a voluntary home visiting program; this screening takes place in birth hospitals, through referrals from prenatal care providers, and other social services. Home visits take place for up to 5 years. We propose to examine child maltreatment by comparing families in the program to demographically-similar families who were not in the program. We will create a comparison group using birth certificate data from children born during the same time period, but not in the program for a variety of reasons (including program availability and not being screened). We utilized propensity score matching to identify similar families using demographic and health behavior data available from the birth certificates (such as neighborhood characteristics, adequate prenatal care, and maternal age). We have a sample of 4,886 program families and 23,904 comparison families. We will link these groups to both Child Protective Services (CPS) data and Medicaid/CHIP data to create 2 separate datasets. Using logistic regression and survival analysis with CPS data, we will compare investigated and substantiated reports; child removals from the home; and timing and severity of reports. Surveillance bias will be estimated using the difference-in-differences approach. Using logistic regression and the Medicaid/CHIP data, we will determine if injuries and injury-related hospitalizations are decreased in the program group. This project would lead to a better understanding of how to evaluate maltreatment in the context of home visiting. Project Relevance One goal of home visiting programs for new mothers is to reduce child abuse and neglect, a serious public health problem with life-long impacts on children. Although home visiting research trials have produced evidence for reductions in maltreatment, this evidence was mixed and few studies have examined these outcomes in community-replication sites. This project will examine the impact of a statewide home visiting program on child maltreatment, measured both by Child Protective Services determinations and by health care utilization for injuries.",The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment,9773203,R03HD096114,"['Accidental Injury', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Policy Maker', 'Prenatal care', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'base', 'care providers', 'child protective service', 'community setting', 'comparison group', 'early childhood', 'health care service utilization', 'human subject', 'maltreatment', 'neglect', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'social']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,83750,550947887,7.275867606020613e-05
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,209484975,0.037581865858396894
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9724447,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2019,130717,164685352,0.012715012191457374
"Changing Talk Online (CHATO): A Pragmatic Trial to Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia Care ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This R61/R33 study will develop and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial in response to PAR-18-585, Pragmatic Trials for Dementia Care I Long-term Services and Support (LTSS) Settings. We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The goal of reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD using this nonpharmacological approach aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. NARRATIVE The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the critical need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R61/R33 pragmatic clinical trial will test interactive online communication training for nursing home staff to reduce ineffective elderspeak communication, with anticipated reductions in behavioral symptoms and inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in residents with dementia.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions.

The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.

"Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management ABSTRACT Despite the over 90% efficacy of diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment, it continues to be the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans. Over 30 million adults in the US have diabetes. Of these, 28% will develop DR and 4.4% will develop vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Currently, less than half of all patients with diabetes receive the recommended annual dilated eye exam and, of those diagnosed with VTDR, only 30% undergo timely treatment. New screening protocols are increasing screening effectiveness, however, even if every patient is screened, the majority of those at increased risk do not receive evidence-based follow-up care; a classic public health failure common to population-based screening. With expertise in health systems engineering and ophthalmology, the research team is uniquely suited to eliminate the root causes of this failure; resulting in a new, comprehensive care model designed to prevent blindness for the 8.9 million Americans with DR. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI)’s focus is on eliminating blindness by applying targeted care coordination for patients at increased risk for VTDR; ensuring they progress through the care path to treatment. However, two significant deficiencies weaken RCI’s ability to deliver effective care coordination. The first is insufficient capacity due to coordinating care for 35% of all patients, though less than 5% actually have VTDR. This derives from the low positive predictive value of the current system, based on a handheld electroretinography and pupillography device deployed in a primary care setting. The first aim is to improve the ability to classify a patient as low- risk for VTDR, thereby reducing the care coordination burden and improving quality and effectiveness. Aim 1: Improve the ability to accurately identify patients at increased risk for VTDR by including patient  health and demographic attributes in a machine learning based predictive algorithm for VTDR diagnosis.  Patient clusters will be identified (a) and used to create sub-population specific risk models (b). The second deficiency is the lack of adherence to follow-up and treatment after identification as increased risk for VTDR. Once a patient is identified as increased risk, the care coordination of the RCI DR program has averaged over five phone calls per patient to achieve follow-up with an eye care provider. The second aim is to identify and eliminate these barriers to coordinated care between patient and provider. Aim 2 Apply text analytics and simulation to improve access, compliance, cost, and equity by enhancing care coordination, from diagnosis to treatment, for patients at increased risk for VTDR. The application of data analytics and systems engineering methods to integrate and improve each critical component of the care path, access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment, will enable a paradigm shift in DR treatment. RCI’s platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model by delivering a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end solution for diabetic retinopathy care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting 8.9 million Americans, is the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans, yet, blindness is preventable in 90% of the cases with timely detection and treatment. To reach the 30 million adults living with diabetes in the US, the Retinal Care DR platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model via a first-of- its-kind end-to-end solution for DR care implementable in any care setting. This will be accomplished via the application of data analytics (machine learning and statistical analysis) and systems engineering (sentiment analysis and simulation) methods to integrate and improve each of the three critical components of the care path: access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment.",Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management,9679729,R41EY029917,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroretinography', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Service delivery model', 'Severities', 'Social Workers', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'care providers', 'classification trees', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model design', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'pupillography', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'sociodemographics']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2019,219356,219896,0.014649880008847465

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,1992588,-0.06135448925465671
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9817043,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,361184,570146095,0.004214024254727011
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9416993,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,537201,641965656,-0.0032811114562659887
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9686505,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,630166,367414121,-0.053837200122817216
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9738886,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,640937,533594881,0.01812577990108992
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9693333,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,646418,558628098,-0.005617604107782474
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9631317,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,656406,1273999,0.009752609624022374
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9722313,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,658069,570146095,0.01784693878864922
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,9840429,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,739992,1405065,-0.03786697045541133
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms.

"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9738159,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,763789,570146095,-0.011517486222541604
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,7626610,0.03087640324004537
"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9552119,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2018,71073,673201228,0.03637212621412656
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9436167,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2018,72343,324592664,-0.010717195696710176
"The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment Project Summary We propose to examine the effectiveness of an early childhood home visiting program to reduce child maltreatment after dissemination to at-risk mothers in Connecticut, through analysis of administrative data. Child maltreatment has life-long impacts on children and is difficult to prevent, but there is evidence that home visiting can reduce maltreatment in the research setting. The effectiveness of home visiting in decreasing child maltreatment after dissemination to community settings is not well established. One challenge in evaluating maltreatment accurately is surveillance bias, which is the increased chance of a report that a family in the home visiting program has, compared to if they were not in the program. These extra reports are hypothesized to be for less severe situations. One way to assess maltreatment that avoids surveillance bias is to examine medical care for injuries, which can be considered a proxy measure for child maltreatment. Although many injuries are accidental, if one group has more injuries than another, this may be evidence that they either have a less safe environment (potential neglect) or have been physically abused. In Connecticut, approximately 40% of first-time mothers are screened for maltreatment risk each year for a voluntary home visiting program; this screening takes place in birth hospitals, through referrals from prenatal care providers, and other social services. Home visits take place for up to 5 years. We propose to examine child maltreatment by comparing families in the program to demographically-similar families who were not in the program. We will create a comparison group using birth certificate data from children born during the same time period, but not in the program for a variety of reasons (including program availability and not being screened). We utilized propensity score matching to identify similar families using demographic and health behavior data available from the birth certificates (such as neighborhood characteristics, adequate prenatal care, and maternal age). We have a sample of 4,886 program families and 23,904 comparison families. We will link these groups to both Child Protective Services (CPS) data and Medicaid/CHIP data to create 2 separate datasets. Using logistic regression and survival analysis with CPS data, we will compare investigated and substantiated reports; child removals from the home; and timing and severity of reports. Surveillance bias will be estimated using the difference-in-differences approach. Using logistic regression and the Medicaid/CHIP data, we will determine if injuries and injury-related hospitalizations are decreased in the program group. This project would lead to a better understanding of how to evaluate maltreatment in the context of home visiting. Project Relevance One goal of home visiting programs for new mothers is to reduce child abuse and neglect, a serious public health problem with life-long impacts on children. Although home visiting research trials have produced evidence for reductions in maltreatment, this evidence was mixed and few studies have examined these outcomes in community-replication sites. This project will examine the impact of a statewide home visiting program on child maltreatment, measured both by Child Protective Services determinations and by health care utilization for injuries.",The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment,9583736,R03HD096114,"['Accidental Injury', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Policy Maker', 'Prenatal care', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'base', 'care providers', 'child protective service', 'community setting', 'comparison group', 'early childhood', 'health care service utilization', 'human subject', 'maltreatment', 'neglect', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'social']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,83750,550947887,7.275867606020613e-05
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation Project Summary The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is one of the most important pieces of federal legislation governing emergency care. EMTALA was passed in 1986 in response to highly publicized incidents of inadequate, delayed or denied treatment of uninsured patients by emergency departments (EDs). The intent of EMTALA was to prevent EDs from practicing patient “dumping,” defined as turning away or transferring patients without authorization or initiation of appropriate stabilizing measures based on their ability to pay. EMTALA requires that all ED patients receive a timely medical screening evaluation, stabilization of identified emergent conditions, and, when indicated, transfer to another facility for higher level of care. EMTALA is an actively enforced law. EMTALA empowers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to authorize EMTALA investigations and grants substantial punitive powers. Since 2005, 43% of U.S. hospitals have been investigated and 27% cited for EMTALA violation. There is 5-fold variation in rates of EMTALA citations across CMS regions. It is unknown whether this variation reflects arbitrary differences in reporting, investigation and enforcement of alleged violations, or true differences in quality of care. Little is known about characteristics of hospitals cited for EMTALA violations or how facility response to citation impacts access to care for patients served by the institution. To evaluate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality we propose to (1) create a longitudinal dataset of EMTALA citations 2005-2016 linked to hospital characteristics and quality of care measures, (2) use multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between facility-level features (e.g., payer mix, hospital quality, ED volume, urban/rural status) and citation for an EMTALA violation, and (3) survey hospital administrators to explore facility response to EMTALA citations. We will conduct an exploratory survey of administrators at California hospitals with recent EMTALA citations (2014-2016, n=96) to characterize and describe operational changes following citations. We expect facilities to respond to EMTALA citations with a variety of measures including modification of on-call specialist coverage, overhauling policies and procedures, educating providers, auditing procedural compliance, and instituting other important but resource intensive measures including hiring additional ED providers, opening beds, or upgrading facilities. Understanding whether EMTALA citations disproportionately impact facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citation will improve understanding of how EMTALA impacts access to emergency care for vulnerable populations. EDs are an essential part of the U.S. safety-net, and the provider of last resort for millions of underserved low-income and minority patients, making this issue of particular importance to the AHRQ priority populations. Project Narrative The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is the most important federal legislation governing emergency care, as EMTALA citations can result in CMS provider agreement termination and lead to hospital closure. Currently there are no published studies examining predictors of EMTALA citation or how facilities respond to citation. Understanding whether EMTALA enforcement disproportionately impacts facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citations will help to elucidate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality.","EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation",9530337,R03HS025281,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R03,2018,100000,324592664,0.030971609234804943
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9504868,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2018,131517,164685352,0.012715012191457374
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,1405065,-0.0007610749179454963
"Planning Changing Talk Online (CHATO): a Clinical Trial Testing the Effects of Online Communication Training for Nursing Home Staff on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Residents with Dementia Abstract  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk, which is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This 1-year R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant will prepare for a future clinical trial (in response to PA- 17-014, Addressing Unmet Needs in Persons with Dementia to Decrease Behavioral Symptoms and Improve Quality of Life) that will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD in 120 NHs. The R34 project will orient our multidisciplinary research team to address new aims; recruit and enroll NHs; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, study documents, and data forms; solidify plans for data management and sharing and fidelity assurance, and obtain IRB approvals. The feasibility of an elderspeak feedback app for staff that may improve CHATO effects will also be demonstrated in the NH to prepare for the clinical trial.  In the planned R01 clinical trial, 120 NHs will be randomized to the CHATO training group or to the control group. BPSD data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs for various approaches will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NINR's symptom management and caregiver support missions, NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The potential for reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD will be explored, addressing the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. Narrative The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years.

"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,209484975,0.037581865858396894

This R61/R33 study will develop and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial in response to PAR-18-585, Pragmatic Trials for Dementia Care I Long-term Services and Support (LTSS) Settings. We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The goal of reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD using this nonpharmacological approach aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9476980,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,300000,276703803,0.033212857676559855
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,551214295,-0.009550590071313855
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9534365,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,449751,228951281,0.043064730552887336
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9681835,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,576678,111231681,0.01113190982289148
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9502383,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,658069,570146095,0.01784693878864922
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9678555,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,658716,558628098,-0.005617604107782474
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8).

"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,38247784,0.0038810129262500112
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9301295,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,217388,524978793,-0.002136738515894777
"Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care Project Summary Value-based healthcare implementation relies on understanding risk. 1 Early models, such as Medicare Advantage, use annual measures of risk under a risk adjustment factor (RAF) to offer financial incentive to payers and hospitals to work together. 2 More advanced models, such as bundled payments, target the periods of greatest quality variability, specifically episodes of care such as joint replacement, oncology diagnosis, and cardiac procedures. In these episodes, many types of providers, from hospitals to outpatient physical therapists, need to work together to reduce rates of complication and readmission. Risk levels are used to adjust payment for payer and providers and to determine which patients require additional resources in the hospital, clinic, or home. Unfortunately, existing risk models lack key features needed for episode-based care, which requires both financial alignment and accurate and immediate information to adjust clinical resources for a given case. 3 4 A better model would include all conditions relevant to an episode rather than just chronic conditions, addition of social determinants, and an automated approach to retrieve the information in hours rather than months. Thus, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I program includes the following Specific Aims: 1. Create the phenotyping components required to define an accurate and comprehensive model  of episode-based risk, including: (i) extract clinical and social features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP), (ii) map concepts including social features to an ontology  that will support normalized data use, (iii) build a feature vector for each record that can be  used to feed a risk model that accounts for relevant clinical and social risk 2. Validate the phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for 10,000 patients In this research program, Phase I will tackle the most difficult challenges, including leveraging narrative text to recognize time-labeled social and clinical features influencing an episode of care. Success criteria will be accurate recognition of key underlying features that have not been available in risk models to date. Phase II will build upon the validated technology to create an episode-based risk model run on narrative and discrete clinical data and tested against actual patient outcomes. Success criteria will be a validated episode-based risk model to support value-based contracting and value-based clinical care. Project Narrative Advanced payment models in United States healthcare rely on accurate assessment of risk and quality. While quality has gained broad attention, risk models remain outdated and poorly suited to advanced payment models. CapsicoHealth proposes an effort to redefine risk models used for episode-based payments, using data sets across the continuum of care and clinical and social determinants of care that have previously been unavailable in computable form. If successful, this effort will impact financial and clinical approaches to value-based healthcare and significantly increase the chance that national efforts to improve cost and quality will be effective.",Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care,9464424,R43LM012798,"['Attention', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Reform', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Insurance', 'Label', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'concept mapping', 'cost', 'feeding', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'interest', 'oncology', 'payment', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'vector']",NLM,"CAPSICOHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,222588,0,0.008244966932980987
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9251814,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,300000,276703803,0.033212857676559855
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9319536,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2017,449993,228951281,0.043064730552887336
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9284760,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,516245,327644200,-0.005617604107782474
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9266749,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phonation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,600547,641965656,-0.0032811114562659887
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9449181,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,663165,367414121,-0.053837200122817216
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9357725,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,687081,570146095,0.01784693878864922
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,1273999,0.009752609624022374
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9278036,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2017,1755747,7626610,0.03087640324004537
"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8).

Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9259659,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2016,63755,673201228,0.03637212621412656
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary As United States healthcare seeks to address inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost, data and technology have become central to all suggested approaches. With newly available electronic health data and massive growth in processing power, the hardest challenges in using clinical data are becoming clear. Big data holds the potential to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value-based payment models. However, it also creates challenges in discriminating accurate data from inaccurate or incomplete information. One of the greatest areas of data inaccuracy is the patient phenotype, or clinical description of the patient. Every clinical decision support tool, population health management system, and payment reform product relies on accurate electronic patient descriptions as its source data. But, the descriptions are not accurate, most notably in terms of completeness and granularity. Recall often falls below 50% in describing a patient’s medical conditions, such as heart failure and cancer. Detailed descriptions such as low ejection fraction heart failure or stage III breast cancer, needed for downstream analytics, are lacking in the discrete record. Poor data puts care delivery, payment reform, and population health efforts in peril. The time is right for technology to proactively define the clinical phenotype from source data, without reliance on current manual approaches. This will necessitate overcoming challenges in harmonizing discrepant narrative and discrete data, inferring when a characteristic such as cough is a primary condition versus symptom of another condition, and screening noise from signal in robust narrative text. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will include the following specific aims: 1. Create the components required to define an accurate and comprehensive clinical phenotype,  including: (i) extract problem, medication, procedure, and lab features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP) and ontologic mapping, (ii) build a large knowledge database  of associated clinical conditions, and (iii) assess extracted features against the knowledge  database to accurately distinguish symptoms from diseases and surface relevant active diseases  in a candidate problem list. 2. Validate the clinical phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for  10,000 patients The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create an automated, accurate, and robust clinical phenotyping engine to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value- based payment models. Project Narrative Individual and global care improvement demands accurate phenotypes. This type of clinical phenotyping is extremely challenging, requiring full clinical data and advanced semantic technologies to develop a longitudinal patient map. The approach, if successful, offers an opportunity to empower national efforts to improve outcomes and reduce costs.",Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare,9199039,R43LM012357,"['Address', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congresses', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'discrete data', 'empowered', 'experience', 'falls', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'payment', 'personalized care', 'population health', 'screening', 'success', 'support tools']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2016,222977,0,-0.006285763878101534
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access.

"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,38247784,0.0038810129262500112
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9104120,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Health', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,253619,524978793,-0.002136738515894777
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9050675,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,300000,276703803,0.033212857676559855

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,9025565,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2016,409330,178569161,0.0020769913690228065
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,551214295,-0.009550590071313855
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9120230,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2016,425000,228951281,0.043064730552887336
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.            ",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9026192,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,578991,641965656,-0.0032811114562659887
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).            ",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9103405,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Boxing', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staff Work Load', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,656467,570146095,0.01784693878864922
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8934087,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,145229,276703803,0.024977552864438465

"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8852594,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comprehension skill', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,194301,304670088,-0.014831820540465836
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result.

"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.            ",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,8948940,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,253619,524978793,-0.002136738515894777
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.                ",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,8798027,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,299888,276703803,0.033212857676559855
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8915498,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2015,419993,228951281,0.043064730552887336
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8830936,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2015,494533,178569161,0.0020769913690228065
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,570146095,0.011805380272237655
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,8926935,U01DE024167,"['11 year old', '9 year old', 'Acute', 'Address', 'African American', 'Appointment', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fluoride Varnishes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laws', 'Letters', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Ohio', 'Oral health', 'Oregon', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Dentition', 'Private Practice', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tooth structure', 'Transportation', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'burden of illness', 'care seeking', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'demographics', 'design', 'elementary school', 'follow-up', 'fourth grade', 'health disparity', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'kindergarten', 'meetings', 'permanent tooth', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'restoration', 'screening', 'second grade', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'three-arm study', 'trend', 'urgent care']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,641750,197030888,0.0036010530997864524
"Worcester Heart Attack Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This population-based study proposes to continue the examination of changing long-term trends in the descriptive epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and out-of hospital deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area. The specific objectives of this population- based study are to examine contemporary (2013 and 2015), as compared with prior (1975-2011), trends in the annual incidence and attack rates of AMI, hospital and post-discharge survival rates, management practices, and out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD. To accomplish these and several additional secondary study objectives, this investigation will be carried out in the 11 acute care general hospitals providing care for residents of central Massachusetts. All new (incident) and recurrent episodes of definite AMI occurring in greater Worcester residents during 2013 and 2015 will be identified from discharge diagnostic printouts obtained from all metropolitan Worcester hospitals of patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and related CHD rubrics. The medical records of these patients will be individually reviewed for validation purposes according to pre-established criteria for AMI. Abstraction of the medical records of patients satisfying the study diagnostic and geographic eligibility criteria will be carried out by trained physicians with the recording of demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes related data. A review of records for additional hospitalizations and a search of death certificates will be carried out to examine the long-term survival status of discharged hospital patients from each of the proposed 2 study years, as well as those identified previously, through 2017. Death certificates will be reviewed to identify cases of out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD occurring during 2013 and 2015. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of carrying out an innovative approach for ""real time"" surveillance of acute coronary disease in this central MA population through the development of natural language processing systems that will automatically extract clinical information from electronic medical records in our most recently hospitalized patient cohort in 2015. Monitoring contemporary trends in our principal study outcomes remains timely given the ongoing publication and dissemination of treatment guidelines and recommendations by national agencies and emphasis on improving quality in processes of care. Given the ""real world"" setting of this investigation, important contemporary insights would be provided into current gaps between ideal and achieved patient care in the broader community setting, to assist in the development of novel educational approaches and incentives to provide more optimal patient care. The results of this investigation will provide important insights from a 40 year (1975-2015) vantage point about the magnitude of, mortality from, and treatment approaches used in the management of the nation's leading cause of death as it affects residents of a large New England metropolitan area. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community.

"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.            ",Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition,8703305,R41GM108104,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Residencies', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'case-based', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical malpractice', 'medical schools', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'undergraduate medical education', 'usability']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R41,2014,144721,0,0.006089568899904755
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.            ",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8678798,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2014,145229,276703803,0.024977552864438465
"Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with multiple chronic conditions - two or more chronic conditions that affect the person at the same time - represent an important group of individuals who receive inadequate quality of healthcare and experience suboptimal health outcomes. Clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy experts are currently uninformed on how to best improve care for these children. This is, in part, because of two methodological challenges that are particularly problematic when studying children with multiple chronic conditions: 1) the ability to comprehensively measure and group comorbid conditions in children and 2) the ability to assess pediatric comorbidity burden on a population level. This proposal will validate and test an innovative set of methods that will help overcome these challenges. Although the set of methods, collectively, is new to the study of children with multiple chronic conditions, we have found components of the set to be feasible and valuable in our prior work. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to adapt for children a publicly available diagnosis classification scheme (i.e., AHRQ's Chronic Condition Indicator and Clinical Classification System) to name and count coexisting chronic conditions in children; 2) to determine the prevalence and the healthcare cost and utilization (total and excessive) of each type of child with multiple chronic conditions; 3) to complete an evidenced-based prioritization process, based on the Pareto Principle, to describe the relative contribution of combinations of chronic conditions to prevalence and to healthcare cost and utilization; and 4) to employ an innovative, machine learning method (i.e., regression tree boosting) to systematically assess every interaction of coexisting chronic conditions in children to predict healthcare cost and utilization The proposed work will be conducted in existing datasets that contain 10.7 million children with comprehensive Medicaid claims data (i.e., community, emergency, home, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy care, etc.) from 28 states as well as 3.7 million hospitalized children from the all-payer, nationally-representative Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Use of the methods and results generated from this proposal will help clinics, hospitals, communities, states, health systems, payers, federal agencies, and others identify children with multiple chronic conditions, describe their coexisting conditions, determine which of these children have the largest impact on the pediatric healthcare system, and quantify how much of their health care cost and utilization could be avoided with high quality of care. This information will help prioritize which subgroups of children with multiple chronic conditions to target for comparative effectiveness research, quality improvement initiatives, and health system redesign. This proposal is aligned with the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to improve the quality of health care for all Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The research in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will rapidly advance our understanding of the U.S. population of children living with multiple chronic conditions. The research will help identify and describe the children living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as the health care cost and utilization experienced by them. The methods and findings from the research will help improve the health and wellbeing of these children.            ",Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions,8726574,R21HS023092,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2014,179808,209484975,-0.0186409239690518
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.            ",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8764466,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,234765,304670088,-0.014831820540465836
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8821956,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2014,449993,228951281,0.043064730552887336
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.                  ",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8641674,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2014,547410,178569161,0.0020769913690228065
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals.

"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.                ",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,8670962,U01DE024167,"['11 year old', '9 year old', 'Acute', 'Address', 'African American', 'Appointment', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fluoride Varnishes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laws', 'Letters', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Ohio', 'Oral health', 'Oregon', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention program', 'Primary Dentition', 'Private Practice', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tooth structure', 'Transportation', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'antibiotic K 4', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'burden of illness', 'care seeking', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'demographics', 'design', 'elementary school', 'follow-up', 'fourth grade', 'health disparity', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'kindergarten', 'meetings', 'permanent tooth', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'restoration', 'screening', 'second grade', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'three-arm study', 'trend', 'urgent care']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,801073,197030888,0.0036010530997864524
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8578484,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,590023,570146095,0.011805380272237655
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing No abstract available  Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and test methods of physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care? This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher.  Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.  SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma.  SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients.  SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively.Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,8259038,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2012,154570,807432003,0.01722876389488573
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize CKD Outcomes & Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Transitional care interventions reduce hospital readmissions and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact transitional care interventions can have for the hospitalized CKD population. CKD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes in CKD. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD risk factors and complications. Focus groups will first be conducted to assure relevance and to refine the intervention. A qualitative research design with convenience sampling will be used to survey recently hospitalized CKD patients (n~10) and their healthcare professionals (n~10). The medication information transfer intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study using a randomized, single-blind clinical trial design. Participants and the pharmacist interventionist will have knowledge of group assignment, but the other investigators and research staff will be blinded. Study entry criteria will include hospitalized patients >21 years old (n=120) who have a diagnosis of CKD stages 3-5 (not including those treated by dialysis or kidney transplant). After obtaining IRB-approved written informed consent, patients will be randomized by computer algorithm for group assignment, stratifying according to diabetes status. The pharmacist will visit participants in the home within 5 days of hospital discharge. The 5As (Assessment, Advice, Agreement, Assistance, and Arrangements) Self-Management Model will be used to implement the medication information transfer intervention. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline and at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures for Specific Aim 1 will be acute care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations). The main outcomes for Specific Aim 2 will be measures of CKD risk factors and complications. Blood pressure will be the primary outcome for this aim because hypertension control is the most consistent recommendation for slowing CKD progression. Logistic regression analyses will be employed controlling for age, sex, CKD stage, co- morbidities, Charleson score, cognitive status, medication adherence and health literacy. Cost will be analyzed based on charges from hospitalization through the following 90 days using a difference-of- difference approach. This contribution is significant because it will define methods to overcome system barriers that result in impaired quality and continuity of care. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates established clinical strategies with systems approaches to improve patient care, thereby testing a fundamentally new approach to advance CKD management.          Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management. This medication information transfer intervention in the transitional care of hospitalized CKD patients will have wide-appeal for adoption by healthcare systems and for other chronic illnesses. The project supports the mission of NIDDK by translating lessons learned from clinical research in CKD into improved clinical outcomes that can be readily measured and anticipated in practice.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units  Project Summary  Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.  The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.  We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting the incorporation continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.  If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.  Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecaststs that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.",Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units,8256763,R01NS066008,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'time interval']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,330138,673201228,0.03469239865716805
"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,8245894,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,719562,550947887,0.036105365412924736
"Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and validate a standardized, claims-based surveillance method to rank hospitals nationally based on diagnosis and procedure codes suggestive of surgical site infection (SSI) following vascular surgery. This work will be part of an ongoing collaboration between the Harvard-based CDC Prevention Epicenter, the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The first aim is to develop a set of diagnosis and procedure codes that suggest SSI following vascular surgery. We will perform a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients who underwent one of the vascular procedures targeted by the national Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in 2005. Approximately 100 codes that have been pre-selected as SSI indicators will be pilot tested in five CDC Prevention Epicenter hospitals using full medical record review. We will use the pilot test to refine our code list to ensure a sensitivity of at least 90% for all confirmed SSIs while attempting to maximize specificity. The second aim is to apply our refined claims-based surveillance method to the 2005-2008 Medicare national claims database. We will rank all hospitals that performed at least 200 targeted vascular procedures in Medicare patients between 2005 and 2008 (average of 50 procedures per year). Ranking will be based on the fraction of patients at each individual hospital with>1 SSI indicator according to the claims-based surveillance method. Rankings will adjust for age, gender, and Romano comorbidity score via a generalized linear mixed model that controls for clustering within institutions. Hospitals will be grouped into deciles based on their adjusted SSI rates. Finally, the third aim is to validate the ranking of hospitals in the best and worst deciles based upon nationwide review of up to 1,500 full-text records. We will perform logistic regression to assess the relationship between having a vascular surgery performed in a best versus worst deciles hospital while controlling for case mix.          Project Narrative   This partnership with CMS and CDC will enhance the national effort to identify hospitals with potentially elevated surgical site infection rates following high volume procedures. We seek to develop a standardized and less resource intensive system that will allow routine identification of hospitals with unusually high rates of these complications. This information will allow targeting of CMS and other resources to improve quality of care  by focusing on hospitals with the greatest need and potential for improvement.",Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.,8101014,F32HS018878,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2011,69107,327644200,0.007649246205931128
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,8144459,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2011,147161,511185245,0.011704472598278538
"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,8066783,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2011,154862,807432003,0.01785356570552097
"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,8136907,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2011,247887,111231681,0.04736911162828003
"Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize CKD Outcomes & Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Transitional care interventions reduce hospital readmissions and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact transitional care interventions can have for the hospitalized CKD population. CKD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes in CKD. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD risk factors and complications. Focus groups will first be conducted to assure relevance and to refine the intervention. A qualitative research design with convenience sampling will be used to survey recently hospitalized CKD patients (n~10) and their healthcare professionals (n~10). The medication information transfer intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study using a randomized, single-blind clinical trial design. Participants and the pharmacist interventionist will have knowledge of group assignment, but the other investigators and research staff will be blinded. Study entry criteria will include hospitalized patients >21 years old (n=120) who have a diagnosis of CKD stages 3-5 (not including those treated by dialysis or kidney transplant). After obtaining IRB-approved written informed consent, patients will be randomized by computer algorithm for group assignment, stratifying according to diabetes status. The pharmacist will visit participants in the home within 5 days of hospital discharge. The 5As (Assessment, Advice, Agreement, Assistance, and Arrangements) Self-Management Model will be used to implement the medication information transfer intervention. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline and at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures for Specific Aim 1 will be acute care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations). The main outcomes for Specific Aim 2 will be measures of CKD risk factors and complications. Blood pressure will be the primary outcome for this aim because hypertension control is the most consistent recommendation for slowing CKD progression. Logistic regression analyses will be employed controlling for age, sex, CKD stage, co- morbidities, Charleson score, cognitive status, medication adherence and health literacy. Cost will be analyzed based on charges from hospitalization through the following 90 days using a difference-of- difference approach. This contribution is significant because it will define methods to overcome system barriers that result in impaired quality and continuity of care. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates established clinical strategies with systems approaches to improve patient care, thereby testing a fundamentally new approach to advance CKD management.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management. This medication information transfer intervention in the transitional care of hospitalized CKD patients will have wide-appeal for adoption by healthcare systems and for other chronic illnesses. The project supports the mission of NIDDK by translating lessons learned from clinical research in CKD into improved clinical outcomes that can be readily measured and anticipated in practice.              Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.           Project Narrative ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP).

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.           Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,8118960,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'burnout', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'longitudinal design', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,376447,570146095,0.027265206743413702
"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring.

"Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and validate a standardized, claims-based surveillance method to rank hospitals nationally based on diagnosis and procedure codes suggestive of surgical site infection (SSI) following vascular surgery. This work will be part of an ongoing collaboration between the Harvard-based CDC Prevention Epicenter, the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The first aim is to develop a set of diagnosis and procedure codes that suggest SSI following vascular surgery. We will perform a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients who underwent one of the vascular procedures targeted by the national Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in 2005. Approximately 100 codes that have been pre-selected as SSI indicators will be pilot tested in five CDC Prevention Epicenter hospitals using full medical record review. We will use the pilot test to refine our code list to ensure a sensitivity of at least 90% for all confirmed SSIs while attempting to maximize specificity. The second aim is to apply our refined claims-based surveillance method to the 2005-2008 Medicare national claims database. We will rank all hospitals that performed at least 200 targeted vascular procedures in Medicare patients between 2005 and 2008 (average of 50 procedures per year). Ranking will be based on the fraction of patients at each individual hospital with>1 SSI indicator according to the claims-based surveillance method. Rankings will adjust for age, gender, and Romano comorbidity score via a generalized linear mixed model that controls for clustering within institutions. Hospitals will be grouped into deciles based on their adjusted SSI rates. Finally, the third aim is to validate the ranking of hospitals in the best and worst deciles based upon nationwide review of up to 1,500 full-text records. We will perform logistic regression to assess the relationship between having a vascular surgery performed in a best versus worst deciles hospital while controlling for case mix.           Project Narrative  This partnership with CMS and CDC will enhance the national effort to identify hospitals with potentially elevated surgical site infection rates following high volume procedures. We seek to develop a standardized and less resource intensive system that will allow routine identification of hospitals with unusually high rates of these complications. This information will allow targeting of CMS and other resources to improve quality of care by focusing on hospitals with the greatest need and potential for improvement.",Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.,7902983,F32HS018878,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2010,66215,327644200,0.007649246205931128
"An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The transition to the ambulatory setting following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for patients.  One important patient safety concern is failure of responsible providers to reliably follow up test results finalized after a patient is discharged. Such failure can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. Automated systems that ensure timely notification of these test results to responsible providers have the potential to mitigate these well documented problems and improve health care quality and safety. The goals of this project are to create an information technology-based automatic notification system to prompt responsible physicians of test results finalized after discharge and to evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of these test results. In the first phase of this study, the components of the system will be designed. These include 1) a query of all tests whose final results are pending at the time of discharge, 2) a query for the identity and email   addresses of the patient's responsible inpatient and ambulatory provider, 3) logic to exclude routinely ordered inpatient tests to avoid provider alert fatigue, 4) automatic email notification of finalized test results to responsible providers once they are available, and 5) documentation of these results in the ambulatory electronic medical record. The system is designed to facilitate timely communication and the creation of a collaborative plan of care among inpatient and outpatient providers during a patient's transition to the ambulatory setting. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to measure the impact of such a system on physician awareness. To minimize contamination, both inpatient and ambulatory providers will be randomized, and patients will only be enrolled if both responsible physicians are in the same arm of the study. Study subjects will include patients discharged from the inpatient general medicine and cardiology services at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary outcome will be awareness of all post-discharge test results among responsible providers. Secondary outcomes will include user satisfaction, awareness of actionable test results (as judged by providers), and whether appropriate actions are subsequently taken in response to these results (based on electronic medical record review). Physician awareness will be determined using an email survey to providers 72 hours after the first finalized test result is available. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the proportion of test results per patient of which a provider is aware using binomial logistic   regression. General estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient and physician characteristics and to cluster by physician. Over a six-month study period, 450 patients will be enrolled in order to provide adequate power to detect an improvement in awareness from 40% to 60% of results. The results of this study will inform future efforts to optimize this type of intervention both at BWH and at other institutions trying to solve this important patient safety problem.           Project Narrative: Physicians are often unaware of test results that return after a patient leaves the hospital, a problem which could lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, unnecessary ordering of additional tests, and patient harm. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic notification system to ensure that a patient's physicians receive test results that are finalized after hospital discharge. We plan to study whether this system improves physicians' awareness of these test results and then share our findings so that other health care systems can learn from our experiences.",An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge,7935467,R21HS018229,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2010,114789,327644200,0.023622229025509693
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world. LSI's goal is to semantically index large medical record repositories accurately against propositions arranged in knowledge ontologies and make these indices available for text mining applications. The phase one research is focused on three specific aims that will lead to breakthroughs in the science of NLP: (1) Develop new statistical NLP algorithms employing a large semantically annotated medical corpus, (2) Semi-automate knowledge ontology generation, and (3) Develop and combine rule based with statistical NLP algorithms to create a superior hybrid NLP system.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,7882499,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2010,154821,807432003,0.01785356570552097
"Automated creation of clinical progress notes with machine learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical encounters require the creation of an enormous amount of documentation. This documentation is tedious, time-consuming, and, in practice, is usually created hours after the encounter has occurred. The requirement to create this documentation places a tremendous burden on the time of clinical staff, and due to pressing workloads, can lead to incorrect recall and clinical data errors. The project intends to prove that progress note portion of this documentation process can be automated by novel application of recent advances in machine learning. A software system will be built with Support Vector Machine theory at its core. The software system can learn from existing clinical progress notes, and then apply those learned method by auto-generating the subjective/analytical portions of the note. The project will also examine learnings from individual physician notes compared to collections of multiple physician notes in order to built a superior model. The project's impact on the quality, and cost, of care should be dramatic. Reductions in documentation error rates and increases in physician productivity equate to an incredible array of quantitative benefits. Qualitatively, the project should make providing healthcare a more enjoyable experience for all involved, given the reduction of administrative time on the part of the highly skilled clinical staff.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities. Currently, creating that documentation requires a manual, and time-consuming process, which reduces the amount of time clinicians spend with patients, and increases the possibility of data errors.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators.

"Medications Prescribed in Emergency Departments for Non-Traumatic Dental Conditio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a growing attention paid by policymakers and health care researchers to the use of emergency departments (ED) for the provision of primary care services because of the continuous increase in medical and dental healthcare cost in the United States. Most patients present to ED with non-traumatic dental conditions (NTDC) and non-urgent medical conditions based on medical criteria. ED use for NTDC visits is a growing dental public health concern that requires urgent research attention. NTDC visits to ED have cost, practice, and program implications and is a potential reason for overcrowding at EDs. However, not enough is known about the population groups and treatments received by these patients at the ED for NTDC visits. NTDCs are best treated at dental offices were definitive and continuity of care can be provided. The overall goal of this project is to address the gap in knowledge related to prescription medications for NTDC visits at EDs and to explore whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in prescribing practices. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to estimate the prevalence and trend of prescription medication use for NTDC visits at EDs from 1996 to 2006. (2) to determine patient factors, provider types, hospital/ED, and geographic characteristics associated with the receipt of prescription medications for NTDC visits from 1996 to 2006. (3) to determine the rates of use of prescription medication for NTDC visits based on physician diagnosis codes, and to specifically evaluate the influence of patients' race/ethnicity on the likelihood of receiving similar prescription for the same physician diagnosis codes. The database for the proposed study, the 1996-2006 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), is the longest continuously running nationally representative survey of ED utilization maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data from NHAMCS provides an extremely rich set of measures on key patient demographics, geographic and hospital/ED characteristics, and provider Information. Access to the database provides a unique opportunity to examine medication prescription practices from 1996 to 2006 to patients presenting to ED for NTDC visits and whether disparities exists. The study population will include children and adults in the database with assigned International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code by ED healthcare providers that meet the criteria for NTDC visits. Logistic regression models will be fit to determine outcome variables associated with other covariates. The findings from the proposed study would serve as a starting point for the development of data-driven program and policy interventions that can be used to improve access to dental care and reduce oral health care disparities, if they exist. Findings from the study will be used to inform the development of prescription medication treatment guidelines for managing patients presenting to ED for NTDC visits in situation where it is unavoidable. In addition, the project provides the opportunity to build research capacity within the dental school and to train dental and graduate students in research methods for potential careers in research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying the different population groups and the medications prescribed for NTDC visits at EDs is important for dental public health programming. Dental public health professionals and stakeholders are able to use this information to development appropriate intervention strategies including the formulation of an appropriate national medication guideline for NTDC visits at EDs, where it is unavoidable.             Public Health Relevance: Identifying the different population groups and the medications prescribed for NTDC visits at EDs is important for dental public health programming.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7942766,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,320155,340417756,0.017176746189983372
"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.           Project Narrative ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP).

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7896527,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'burnout', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'longitudinal design', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,401653,570146095,0.027265206743413702

Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7937047,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2010,493567,178185562,-0.009311760190103553
"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7941068,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2010,496075,111231681,0.04736911162828003
"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7867849,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,759696,550947887,0.036105365412924736
"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7877057,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,771496,673201228,0.025845509246594203
"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have periodically published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pneumonia. In 2005, the ATS/IDSA published guidelines which define a new subset of pneumonia entitled Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP). HCAP pertains to patients that have frequently interacted with the Health Care system prior to pneumonia, which is thought to increase risk for infections caused by multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The guidelines recommend aggressive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment regimens for HCAP. Research specific to HCAP is limited and the guideline recommendations have been questioned. Proposal Aims include: 1) to compare clinical outcome of patients with HCAP that receive standard community acquired pneumonia (CAP) therapy to those that receive alternative therapy such as guideline similar therapy (GTS)]; 2) identify risk factors for MDR bacteria including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to non-MDR bacteria and develop models that accurately identify patients infected with MDR. This will be a multi- center retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs Medical Center inpatients with HCAP. Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for potential confounding and selection bias associated with non-random treatment allocation. Generalized estimating equations will be used to characterize associations between 30-day survival and treatments: standard CAP; anti-MRSA and anti-Pseudomonas or GST, anti-MRSA, anti-Pseudomonas, or other therapies. In Aim 2 MDR status will be determined for all subjects. Logistic regression will be used to develop descriptive models of MDR risk based on non-HCAP specific risk criteria reported in the guidelines as well as HCAP specific data from the cohort. The process will be repeated for specific MDR pathogens: MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best model of MDR status will be refitted with MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa data and compared to pathogen- specific derived models. The proposed study will determine whether adherence to HCAP guideline recommended treatments improve survival. Further developing specific prediction rules for MDR pathogens will refine future empirical HCAP antibiotic selection. Finally, determining which patients may benefit most from empirical MDR directed antibiotic therapy may help to limit antibiotic resistance. R&R: Other Project Materials 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Patients with exposure to the Health Care system resources are at increased risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently antibiotic resistant bacteria cause Health Care Associated pneumonia, what type of Health Care exposures are related to developing a pneumonia due to resistant bacteria, and what antibiotic treatment combinations work the best for Health Care Associated pneumonia. This study will improve public health by helping health care providers choose the right antibiotics when treating Health Care Associated pneumonia and not using more antibiotics than necessary.                n/a","Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia",7640772,R03AI074894,"['Adherence', 'Alternative Therapies', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Macrolides', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Refit', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Societies', 'Sputum', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'drug resistant bacteria', 'health care model', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'standard care']",NIAID,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,62312,797976,0.026027157344951545
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to the Iowa Quitline for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and 4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of guideline- recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables. In secondary analyses, we will assess the change in attitudes of ED nurses and physicians toward smoking cessation counseling. This feasibility study will determine the receptivity of patients and ED staff to the guideline-based intervention and will provide estimates of effect size in planning a full scale multi-site clinical trial of the study intervention in community hospital EDs.          n/a",The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department,7651300,R21DA021607,"['Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Biochemical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Iowa', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Telefacsimile', 'Telephone', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse prevention', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'community based care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'multi-site trial', 'nicotine replacement', 'quitline', 'routine care', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2009,112500,193405667,0.006452425010673431
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,7693117,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2009,145926,511185245,0.011704472598278538
"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,7639826,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2009,153790,807432003,0.01785356570552097
"An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The transition to the ambulatory setting following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for patients.  One important patient safety concern is failure of responsible providers to reliably follow up test results finalized after a patient is discharged. Such failure can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. Automated systems that ensure timely notification of these test results to responsible providers have the potential to mitigate these well documented problems and improve health care quality and safety. The goals of this project are to create an information technology-based automatic notification system to prompt responsible physicians of test results finalized after discharge and to evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of these test results. In the first phase of this study, the components of the system will be designed. These include 1) a query of all tests whose final results are pending at the time of discharge, 2) a query for the identity and email   addresses of the patient's responsible inpatient and ambulatory provider, 3) logic to exclude routinely ordered inpatient tests to avoid provider alert fatigue, 4) automatic email notification of finalized test results to responsible providers once they are available, and 5) documentation of these results in the ambulatory electronic medical record. The system is designed to facilitate timely communication and the creation of a collaborative plan of care among inpatient and outpatient providers during a patient's transition to the ambulatory setting. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to measure the impact of such a system on physician awareness. To minimize contamination, both inpatient and ambulatory providers will be randomized, and patients will only be enrolled if both responsible physicians are in the same arm of the study. Study subjects will include patients discharged from the inpatient general medicine and cardiology services at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary outcome will be awareness of all post-discharge test results among responsible providers. Secondary outcomes will include user satisfaction, awareness of actionable test results (as judged by providers), and whether appropriate actions are subsequently taken in response to these results (based on electronic medical record review). Physician awareness will be determined using an email survey to providers 72 hours after the first finalized test result is available. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the proportion of test results per patient of which a provider is aware using binomial logistic   regression. General estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient and physician characteristics and to cluster by physician. Over a six-month study period, 450 patients will be enrolled in order to provide adequate power to detect an improvement in awareness from 40% to 60% of results. The results of this study will inform future efforts to optimize this type of intervention both at BWH and at other institutions trying to solve this important patient safety problem.           Project Narrative: Physicians are often unaware of test results that return after a patient leaves the hospital, a problem which could lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, unnecessary ordering of additional tests, and patient harm. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic notification system to ensure that a patient's physicians receive test results that are finalized after hospital discharge. We plan to study whether this system improves physicians' awareness of these test results and then share our findings so that other health care systems can learn from our experiences.",An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge,7773972,R21HS018229,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,169859,327644200,0.023622229025509693
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7908952,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'meetings', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2009,170662,7946311,7.144340732189289e-05
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,246330700,0.01994287555316781
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7691699,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,311821,340417756,0.017176746189983372
"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7675325,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'burnout', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'longitudinal design', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,396835,570146095,0.027265206743413702
"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7761795,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2009,447671,111231681,0.04736911162828003
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7825111,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2009,494693,178185562,-0.009311760190103553
"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7620456,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,791582,550947887,0.036105365412924736
"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7567140,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,953185,673201228,0.025845509246594203
"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have periodically published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pneumonia. In 2005, the ATS/IDSA published guidelines which define a new subset of pneumonia entitled Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP). HCAP pertains to patients that have frequently interacted with the Health Care system prior to pneumonia, which is thought to increase risk for infections caused by multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The guidelines recommend aggressive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment regimens for HCAP. Research specific to HCAP is limited and the guideline recommendations have been questioned. Proposal Aims include: 1) to compare clinical outcome of patients with HCAP that receive standard community acquired pneumonia (CAP) therapy to those that receive alternative therapy such as guideline similar therapy (GTS)]; 2) identify risk factors for MDR bacteria including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to non-MDR bacteria and develop models that accurately identify patients infected with MDR. This will be a multi- center retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs Medical Center inpatients with HCAP. Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for potential confounding and selection bias associated with non-random treatment allocation. Generalized estimating equations will be used to characterize associations between 30-day survival and treatments: standard CAP; anti-MRSA and anti-Pseudomonas or GST, anti-MRSA, anti-Pseudomonas, or other therapies. In Aim 2 MDR status will be determined for all subjects. Logistic regression will be used to develop descriptive models of MDR risk based on non-HCAP specific risk criteria reported in the guidelines as well as HCAP specific data from the cohort. The process will be repeated for specific MDR pathogens: MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best model of MDR status will be refitted with MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa data and compared to pathogen- specific derived models. The proposed study will determine whether adherence to HCAP guideline recommended treatments improve survival. Further developing specific prediction rules for MDR pathogens will refine future empirical HCAP antibiotic selection. Finally, determining which patients may benefit most from empirical MDR directed antibiotic therapy may help to limit antibiotic resistance. R&R: Other Project Materials 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Patients with exposure to the Health Care system resources are at increased risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently antibiotic resistant bacteria cause Health Care Associated pneumonia, what type of Health Care exposures are related to developing a pneumonia due to resistant bacteria, and what antibiotic treatment combinations work the best for Health Care Associated pneumonia. This study will improve public health by helping health care providers choose the right antibiotics when treating Health Care Associated pneumonia and not using more antibiotics than necessary.                n/a","Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia",7532576,R03AI074894,"['Adherence', 'Alternative Therapies', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Macrolides', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Other Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recommendation', 'Refit', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Score', 'Selection Bias', 'Societies', 'Sputum', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'day', 'drug resistant bacteria', 'health care model', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling']",NIAID,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,61996,797976,0.026027157344951545
"Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this Developmental Grant Proposal for Collaborative International Projects are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) using a nurse-delivered motivational intervention, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS + 6) in the emergency room (ER) in Sosnowiec, Poland; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine SBIRT study to a non-academic ER setting outside of the U.S. The SBIRT study, recently funded by NIAAA and SAMHSA, is the first multisite, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER. We will conduct a blinded randomized brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and noninjured patients over the aged of 18 will be screened for at-risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Those screening positive will be asked to participate in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and brief intervention, with n=292 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months.      Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk taking disposition and readiness and stage of change. Prior research in the ER in Sosnowiec and a pilot feasibility study of SBIRT in Sosnowiec suggest: 1) a large number of ""at risk"", heavy problem and dependent drinkers who meet screening criteria for brief intervention in a relatively short period of time; 2) a socialized health care system which provides equal access to care and is not subject to selection bias affecting patient access; 3) a patient sample covering a large geographic area; 4) a stable environment facilitating high follow-up rates post-intervention; and, 5) a well integrated referral system and high accessibility to alcohol treatment services. Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. The ER is an important setting for screening and brief intervention for those with alcohol-related problems in order to reduce subsequent alcohol-related ER visits and associated costs and increase quality of life. This project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes.          n/a",Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland,7371147,R21AA016081,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Cities', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human Resources', 'Impulsivity', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Poland', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Visit', 'Week', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'day', 'drinking', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'injured', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'motivational intervention', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'social', 'trauma centers', 'willingness']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2008,166229,20386554,-0.03317193365677138
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety.

"The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to the Iowa Quitline for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and 4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of guideline- recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables. In secondary analyses, we will assess the change in attitudes of ED nurses and physicians toward smoking cessation counseling. This feasibility study will determine the receptivity of patients and ED staff to the guideline-based intervention and will provide estimates of effect size in planning a full scale multi-site clinical trial of the study intervention in community hospital EDs.          n/a",The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department,7380300,R21DA021607,"['Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Biochemical', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Iowa', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Telefacsimile', 'Telephone', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse prevention', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'community based care', 'day', 'design', 'desire', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'nicotine replacement', 'quitline', 'size', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2008,300000,193405667,0.006452425010673431
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,7946311,7.144340732189289e-05
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,246330700,0.01994287555316781
"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7496605,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Love', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,393213,570146095,0.027265206743413702
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7461372,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'computerized', 'day', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,823164,550947887,0.036105365412924736
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,228951281,0.013580062624651784

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,558628098,0.030289489241480796
"Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this Developmental Grant Proposal for Collaborative International Projects are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) using a nurse-delivered motivational intervention, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS + 6) in the emergency room (ER) in Sosnowiec, Poland; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine SBIRT study to a non-academic ER setting outside of the U.S. The SBIRT study, recently funded by NIAAA and SAMHSA, is the first multisite, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER. We will conduct a blinded randomized brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and noninjured patients over the aged of 18 will be screened for at-risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Those screening positive will be asked to participate in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and brief intervention, with n=292 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months.      Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk taking disposition and readiness and stage of change. Prior research in the ER in Sosnowiec and a pilot feasibility study of SBIRT in Sosnowiec suggest: 1) a large number of ""at risk"", heavy problem and dependent drinkers who meet screening criteria for brief intervention in a relatively short period of time; 2) a socialized health care system which provides equal access to care and is not subject to selection bias affecting patient access; 3) a patient sample covering a large geographic area; 4) a stable environment facilitating high follow-up rates post-intervention; and, 5) a well integrated referral system and high accessibility to alcohol treatment services. Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. The ER is an important setting for screening and brief intervention for those with alcohol-related problems in order to reduce subsequent alcohol-related ER visits and associated costs and increase quality of life. This project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes.          n/a",Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland,7209884,R21AA016081,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Cities', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human Resources', 'Impulsivity', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Poland', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Visit', 'Week', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'day', 'drinking', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'injured', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'motivational intervention', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'social', 'trauma centers', 'willingness']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2007,182784,20386554,-0.03317193365677138
"Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Diagnosing a patient's condition and predicting the patient's outcomes are critical activities in clinical care. The better these activities can be performed, the better the patient's healthcare results are likely to be. Similarly, efficient use of healthcare resources depends upon being able to determine accurately when and where a resource is likely to be useful, which also involves making predictions. Even modest improvements in predictive accuracy can at times have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Thus, for both individual patients and for society at large, making accurate healthcare predictions is an important task.      There is a clear trend toward having more and more patient data that is available electronically in healthcare information systems and in databases of clinical research studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to construct evidence-based predictive models from these data sources. Indeed, numerous clinical prediction models have already been constructed. Typically, a single prediction model has been induced from the data, and then applied -- as relevant -- to each future patient. Such a population-wide model is constructed to try to optimize its average predictive performance on all future patient cases to which it is applied. Model induction does not take advantage of information about the patient case at hand, which could potentially enhance the form and content of the model that is constructed.      The current project will investigate methods that construct patient-specific models that are sensitive to information about the patient at hand. These new methods will be evaluated for their performance in predicting patient outcomes in the diverse domains of sepsis, heart failure and substance use disorders. A variety of current population-wide model-construction methods, including logistic regression and neural networks, will serve as controls.      If patient-specific models can improve upon the predictive performance of population-wide models, as seems plausible, the added performance is likely to provide substantial benefit as a component of future computer-based decision-support systems for clinical care. n/a",Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data,7185137,R01LM008374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Societies', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,278631,570146095,-0.015064953918681831
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7217497,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,361696,558628098,0.01994287555316781
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,7946311,7.144340732189289e-05
"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7213092,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Love', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,398357,570146095,0.027265206743413702
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface.

"Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale and Objectives: Significant racial/ethnic disparities in health care utilization exist among adolescents. When adolescents do access the system, the preventive services delivery is below the recommended levels. However, little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery. Minority adolescents have higher rates of risky health behaviors and associated outcomes in several key areas that are preventable. The long-term research objective is to decrease racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent health behaviors and outcomes. Specific aims are to determine if: 1) There are racial/ethnic disparities in the delivery of adolescent preventive services; 2) An intervention to increase the delivery of preventive services in primary care reduces racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of preventive services; 3) Receipt of preventive services has a similar effect on adolescents of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Research Design: Population: 2 samples will be utilized: 1) UCSF Sample: 3369 adolescents participated in an evaluation of adolescent preventive services in a large managed care organization; and 2) CHIS sample: 2898 California adolescents participated in The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 2001. Measures: UCSF adolescent participants completed surveys immediately following clinical well care visits that queried whether providers screened and counseled them during the visit in 3 target areas: substance use, safety, and sexual behavior. A UCSF subsample also participated in a longitudinal study of health behaviors, completing health outcome and self-efficacy surveys prior to well visits and one year later at a 2nd annual well visit. CHIS participants completed phone surveys that included their attendance of well visits and whether their providers screened them in target areas. Methods: Secondary data analyses of these established data sets will be conducted to test for the presence of racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent preventive services and outcomes. We will conduct multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to examine the proposed aims. Outcomes for aims 1 and 2 are provider screening and counseling during well visits. Outcomes for aim 3 are behavior change and self- efficacy in the longitudinal subsample of adolescents who received preventive services. We will control for covariation from variables including adolescent characteristics, such as age and gender, and family characteristics, such as socio-economic status. Public Health Relevance: The identification of racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery could increase awareness and prompt improvements in healthcare for all adolescents. The identification of disparities in health behavior and self-efficacy outcomes as the result of preventive services could lead to increased focus on meeting the needs of adolescents of differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.         n/a",Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes,7128193,R03NR009397,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health behavior', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'managed care', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'sex behavior', 'statistics /biometry', 'substance abuse related disorder', 'transportation /recreation safety']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R03,2006,73970,0,-0.019620602458336456
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7124706,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2006,135000,558628098,0.030289489241480796

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,558628098,0.010231116462437018
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7083613,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,535569,673201228,0.029163525955821223

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%.

This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6917854,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,593264,673201228,0.029163525955821223
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6930547,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disasters', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'geographic site', 'human data', 'human population study', 'public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2005,594222,232986943,0.016105739472777617
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,228951281,0.011254257659247069
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6781785,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,468590,558628098,0.010231116462437018

"Ethnic Variation in Hospice Use Among Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Within the last three decades, hospice care has emerged as an important form of end-of-life care in the United States. Hospice care provides an alternative to traditional, curative medicine by offering dying patients palliation from physical, emotional and spiritual suffering. In the last decade, hospice utilization in the United States has increased rapidly. In addition, the type of patient entering hospice care has changed. Until recently, the majority of patients using hospice care were older, middle class, and non-Hispanic Whites with a cancer diagnosis. Now, as the older adult population becomes more ethnically diverse and advances continue to be made in life-prolonging technologies, the profile of the typical hospice patient is also changing.      There is a growing concern in the hospice community that members of racial and ethnic minority groups are underutilizing hospice care in comparison to Non-Hispanic Whites. It is important to: 1) determine if disparities in hospice utilization exist among different racial and ethnic groups; and 2) explain why these disparities exist. The purpose of this study is to examine variation in the use of hospice care by patient race and ethnicity.      The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) investigate differences in the use of hospice care by patient race and ethnicity; 2) examine racial and ethnic differences in hospice use by type of cancer diagnosis; 3) assess racial and ethnic differences in the use of hospice care by geographic location; and   4) examine variation in the use of hospice care over time by patient race and ethnicity.      Data from the linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database will be used to study hospice care utilization in subjects diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal or prostate cancer from 1986 to 1996 at age 65 and over who died from 1991 to 1999. The SEER population covers approximately 14% of the United States. Logistic regression analyses and chi-square analyses will be used to achieve the study goals. The findings will contribute to the existing knowledge of hospice care utilization among four racial and ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians and Pacific Islanders) in the United States.         n/a",Ethnic Variation in Hospice Use Among Cancer Patients,6594260,R03HS013547,"['African American', ' Asians', ' Hispanic Americans', ' Pacific Islander', ' breast neoplasms', ' caucasian American', ' clinical research', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' epidemiology', ' geographic difference', ' health care service utilization', ' health disparity', ' health services research tag', ' hospices', ' hospital length of stay', ' human subject', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' prostate neoplasms', ' racial /ethnic difference']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R03,2003,32400,0,0.0017977135828113327
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6640934,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2003,357169,570146095,0.0381273541766107

Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,673201228,0.029163525955821223
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6673408,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disasters', ' disease outbreaks', ' early diagnosis', ' geographic site', ' human data', ' human population study', ' public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2003,606068,232986943,0.016105739472777617
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6490857,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2002,430002,570146095,0.0381273541766107
"CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES)   The number of children who are maltreated each year in the US                      continues to increase. Despite this alarming statistic, primary care                 practitioners (PCPs)are not frequent reporters of suspected child abuse              (SCAN)to government child protection agencies (CPS). The reasons for this are        not yet understood. This proposed research will provide the first                    comprehensive description and analysis of the management of SCAN in primary          care practices.                                                                                                                                                           This study is a prospective descriptive study of practitioner management of          16,000 childhood injuries. Data will be collected in the Pediatric Research in       Office Setting (PROS)Network using a protocol that is derived from one that          was piloted in a regional practice-based research network (PBRN). Four hundred       PROS PCP will each gather information about 40 consecutive injury visits. They       will report medical diagnosis, demographic information, and their level of           suspicion for child physical abuse. Follow-up telephone calls to the PCP will        elicit further information about the management of these injuries. This data         will be used to construct vignettes. The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.

"Nurse Staffing and Adverse Patient Outcomes A public concern pertaining to patient safety is that hospitals may currently be providing inadequate nurse staffing, consequently jeopardizing the quality of patient care. Recently, several studies have examined the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Whereas these studies have produced empirical findings supporting this relationship, this study examines the cost-benefits of increasing nurse staffing as well as the nurse staffing-patient outcomes relationship. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to examine hospital characteristics that affect nurse staffing; (2) to examine the effects of nurse staffing on the occurrence of adverse events; (3) to assess the consequences of adverse events on morbidity, mortality and medical costs and decreased medical care costs due to decreases in adverse events as the benefits of increasing nurse staffing. A cross-sectional study design will be conducted using two existing databases of California acute care hospitals. Nurse staffing will be measured by six indicators, including nursing intensity-adjusted nursing hours per patient worked by registered nurses, all nursing personnel, and agency or contract personnel, skill mix, overtime index, and labor productivity. Adverse events include adverse drug events, patient falls, pressure ulcers, and nosocomial infections. These adverse events will be detected by using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnosis codes. Morbidity attributed to adverse events will be indirectly measured by prolonged length of stay. Analyses will employ multiple regression, logistic regression, or mixed models, depending on the dependent variables. Patient characteristics will be controlled for to isolate the effects of nurse staffing on patient outcomes. The cost benefit analysis from the hospital perspective will examine whether the benefits of increasing nurse staffing are greater than its costs. This study will provide guidelines for determining appropriate nurse staffing levels in hospitals with differing characteristics, such as patient populations and types of care provided.  n/a",Nurse Staffing and Adverse Patient Outcomes,6352397,R03HS011397,"['accidental falls', ' clinical research', ' cost effectiveness', ' decubitus ulcer', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care facility information system', ' health services research tag', ' hospital analysis', ' hospital length of stay', ' hospital patient care', ' human data', ' human morbidity', ' human mortality', ' iatrogenic disease', ' nurse patient relations', ' nursing administration', ' nursing care quality', ' nursing personnel', ' outcomes research', ' patient safety /medical error', ' statistics /biometry']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2001,31116,641965656,0.020269305103869956
"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.  Results will be used to finalize the software system and prepare collateral materials necessary for commercial production.

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,0,-0.013590846390064498
