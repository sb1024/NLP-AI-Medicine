"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Censuses', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Set', 'Dermatology', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research Subjects', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'base', 'disease classification', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population stratification', 'racial bias', 'recruit']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,560644462,0.10819420023118831
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. Falls are a significant public health issue for older adults and critical for seniors in low income settings; therefore, the study is highly relevant to public health.",Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults,10093338,R03AG069793,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age-Years', 'Attitude', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Environment', 'Country', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fall prevention', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Fracture', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human Activities', 'Impaired cognition', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nurses', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional decline', 'functional status', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'improved functioning', 'innovative technologies', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motion sensor', 'physical conditioning', 'preference', 'prevent', 'research study', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'social vulnerability']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2020,81000,593605914,0.13288860705086336
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9830682,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,100000,63611576,0.05234199660723526
"Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 80% of older adults with cancer. It is associated with the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), which have risk greater than benefit in older adults. In older adults with cancer, PP/PIMs have been associated in some studies with adverse outcomes, including poor adherence to and tolerance of cancer therapy and decrease in physical functioning. However, these data have been inconsistent, and studies to date have examined specific populations (such as disease-specific subgroups enrolled in clinical trials) that may not be representative of the general population of older adults with cancer. This proposal presents a 2-year research and career development plan focused on examining a cohort (n=370) of older adults with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy in community oncology clinics. This is a secondary analysis of the control arm of the Geriatric Assessment Intervention for Patients Aged 70 and Over Receiving Chemotherapy or Similar Agents for Advanced Cancer (“GAP”): Reducing Toxicity in Older Adults study (URCC 13059, principal investigator is primary mentor Dr. Mohile), describing prevalence and patterns of PP/PIMs as well as the relationship of PP/PIMs to adverse outcomes including relative dose intensity of chemotherapy (RDI, a ratio of received to standard doses of chemotherapy), chemotherapy toxicity, and functional trajectory. The candidate, Dr. Erika Ramsdale, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and is board-certified in both Oncology and Geriatric Medicine. This proposal builds upon her prior systematic review of PP/PIMs in older patients with cancer, showing the limited data available in the literature, and her work demonstrating that PP/PIMs are associated with functional impairments in older adults with advanced cancer prior to initiating chemotherapy. The aims of the proposed study are: 1/to test the hypotheses that PP/PIMs rates will be higher than reported in most prior studies, and over-the-counter medications will comprise the majority of PIMs detected; 2/to examine the association of PP/PIMs and the following adverse outcomes in older adults with cancer starting chemotherapy: chemotherapy tolerability at 3 months (RDI, grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity), and functional decline over 3 months. An exploratory aim will also compare the performance of regression and other supervised classification methods to model and predict factors influencing chemotherapy toxicity, including PP/PIMs and functional status. The proposal describes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to develop complementary skills and knowledge in in polypharmacy, quantitative analysis, and data science. Under the guidance of her primary mentor Dr. Supriya Mohile, co-mentors Dr. Holly Holmes and Dr. Martin Zand, and advisor Dr. Eva Culakova, she will advance her skills in these areas with the long-term goal of becoming an independent geriatric oncology researcher implementing and testing multi-level interventions to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polypharmacy, or taking multiple concurrent medications, is very common in older adults with cancer receiving cancer treatment, and increases the risk of taking one or more medications which are “potentially inappropriate” based on having higher risk than benefit in older adults. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications may be associated with adverse outcomes such as chemotherapy toxicity and functional decline in older adults with cancer. This proposal will examine the prevalence of polypharmacy, patterns of medication use, and impact of polypharmacy on tolerability of cancer treatment and functional trajectory in older patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy.","Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy",10027448,R03AG067977,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Antihistamines', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Companions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Holly', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'impaired functional status', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'interest', 'older patient', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'systematic review']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R03,2020,154000,179705973,0.13558015042831037
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,338121506,0.12905755768117266
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low-risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs).

"Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults Approximately 3 million young adults aged 18-44 years currently have diabetes in the United States. This number is projected to increase to ~5.8 million by 2060. Differentiating diabetes types is crucial, because the etiology, treatments, and outcomes of diabetes differ substantially by type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for ~17% and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ~75% of total diabetes in US young adults. This distribution of diabetes types continuously evolves. We do not have a large-scale surveillance system to monitor the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The widespread use and increasing functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems substantially increase the quantity, breadth, and timeliness of data available for surveillance and reduce costs compared with population-based registries and surveys. EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~6 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adults from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US young adults with those in young adults from other countries and regions. This study is innovative, because it will detect a false negative rate as low as 0.2%, leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. This study will advance our understanding of the age, sex, racial/ethnic, and geographic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The obtained surveillance data will inform planning for healthcare needs, prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources, and reduce health disparities via identifying and prioritizing subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities. The burden of diabetes has been increasing considerably in recent decades in US young adults. However, there is no large-scale surveillance system for monitoring the burden of diabetes by type in US young adults. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US young adults according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults,10085448,U18DP006502,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,91477866,0.0035490566889686695
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,327644200,0.09376919615658585
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,9957331,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2020,251250,294146927,0.07540282721361333
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,533302350,0.04164519267893337
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,61050884,0.028535457915487696
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportunity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,10019452,R01AG067416,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2020,296138,6229561,-0.028100390382898275
"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10050234,R61AG068945,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care disparity', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'multi-site trial', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'peer', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,315340,593605914,0.09778545684994339

"Inflammatory and ADRD Biomarker Predictors of Perioperative Digital Clock Drawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9879630,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,454065,641965656,0.15935517233698954
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9850564,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,466715,83544663,0.05644791771801694
"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health. The tools proposed in this research may provide a low-cost, scalable method to improve detection of cognitive decline.",A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings,10091002,R61AG069729,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Appointment', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Excision', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Health system', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'care providers', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'patient health information', 'patient screening', 'population health', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'uptake']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R61,2020,564218,110237370,0.026463932663881147
"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'caucasian American', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'health administration', 'health difference', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'racial difference', 'racial health disparity', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,179705973,0.044462845338819536
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general.

"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10055446,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,852784,558628098,-0.0003018773728335293
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10044799,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,1506851,641965656,0.01932871650275724
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9623369,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,100000,63611576,0.05234199660723526
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,338121506,0.12905755768117266
"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. With more than 130 million people expected to be effected by dementia and other cognitive disorders by 2050, the burden and global annual costs of 818 billion USD is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades.

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9722990,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep pattern', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,260797,570146095,0.06783711052180873
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,61050884,0.028535457915487696
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impracticalfor large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportun ity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,9977514,R01AG067416,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2019,300000,6229561,-0.028180353880818767
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a  major positive impact because they will provide proof-­of-­principle for the use of an Audio-­PHL that utilizes the  benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed  research will integrate audio-­recordings of clinic visits into a Personal Health Library (Audio-­PHL), using data  science methods to link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be  retrieved, organized, edited and shared by patients. It is expected that the Audio-­PHL will be easy to use and  highly utilized, making patients and caregivers more knowledgeable and confident of their health care needs,  resulting in greater self-­management capabilities. ",Improving patient and caregiver

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9873378,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,368614,641965656,0.15935517233698954

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9739350,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,426737,188894159,0.11092197450118309
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9614566,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2019,438611,83544663,0.05644791771801694
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,92000,63611576,0.05234199660723526
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,338121506,0.12905755768117266
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9553862,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,171298,5678328,0.09469580310999566
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,304670088,0.011930054613392367
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9536656,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,246106,560644462,0.03322831875423434
"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9534484,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,298548,570146095,0.06783711052180873
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9706344,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,331584,641965656,0.15935517233698954
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a  major positive impact because they will provide proof-­of-­principle for the use of an Audio-­PHL that utilizes the  benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed  research will integrate audio-­recordings of clinic visits into a Personal Health Library (Audio-­PHL), using data

"Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement) Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Summary Dementia affects over 5 million older adults in the US, with vast implications for individual patients, their caregivers, and social programs designed to support increasing health care needs. Research to date has not fully clarified the role that multiple co-occurring chronic conditions (multimorbidity) play in the provision of appropriate care for racially and ethnically diverse groups of older adults with mild or more severe cognitive impairment. As a result, there is a need for greater understanding of the complex interactions between existing morbidity combinations, cognitive impairment, and the receipt of essential and appropriate care. As of yet, it is unclear whether specific multimorbidity combinations alongside cognitive impairment present greater difficulty in accessing good-quality, and appropriate care and preventive services among older adults from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The supplement extends from the research conducted in the parent award by focusing on older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and co-existing chronic conditions. The goal of this supplement is to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care received for older adults with dementia and competing multimorbidity care demands. We propose to use existing databases and multimorbidity combinations and patterns recently found in the parent grant. Our proposed research employs data from over 20 years of nationally-representative biennial surveys (~38,000 sampled people in the Health & Retirement Study) linked to Medicare claims. We propose two aims:  Aim 1. Determine racial and ethnic differences in receipt of preventive services among older adults with  mild or severe cognitive impairment and various multimorbidity combinations.  Aim 2. Evaluate racial and ethnic differences in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and  emergency department (ED) visits with discharge among older adults with mild or severe cognitive  impairment and various multimorbidity patterns. Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Narrative Our findings will inform policies and programs that seek to delay and avert costly and intensive levels of care among racially/ethnically diverse older adults with dementia. By identifying disease combinations with dementia associated with poor uptake of preventive services and high use of preventable hospital and emergency department services, future work can inform treatment decision-making and practice guidelines that are better attuned to the needs of vulnerable older adults with mild and severe cognitive decline.",Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement),9716886,R01AG055681,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Institutionalization', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'parent grant', 'premature', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,373593,304670088,0.1414704452568268
"Deep Learning Gait Analytics for Primary Care Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is the third leading cause of death in older adults in the US. Over 4.7 million Americans aged 65 and older live with AD and this number is expected to climb to nearly 14 million by 2050. However, fewer than 50% of individuals with AD have been diagnosed. and patients who have the condition are unlikely to receive a full diagnostic workup to identify the cause(s) of their impairment. Detection of functional markers is an essential first step toward prevention and early diagnosis of MCI, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias. Recently, several highly regarded clinical aging studies have demonstrated that subtle changes in gait are early, sensitive and specific, noninvasive risk markers for both cognitive decline and fall risk. The majority of these clinical investigations have used an instrumented mat system (e.g. the GaitRite system) that measures spatio-temporal gait parameters from footfalls. Although the literature is consistent about the potential for spatio-temporal footfall-based metrics as a predictor of MCI and dementia, the technology industry has not delivered an accurate yet affordable solution appropriate for widespread use in a primary care setting. A new and novel approach is required to transfer the significant clinical research findings to clinical practice. The goal of this SBIR is to create an accurate, low cost, simple-to-use primary care clinical screening tool for MCI and dementia and a risk assessment and stratification tool for older adults with normal cognition. This will be accomplished by commercializing recent research in novel software-based deep learning marker-less motion capture and advanced kinematic analysis methods. A secure mobile application and cloud-based big data analytics platform delivers this Software-as-a Service to providers with the low cost and ease-of use required to accelerate adoption. This new approach applies deep learning technology to measure footfall-based gait parameters. It can replicate the level of precision and accuracy of expensive (>$35,000) and space-consuming electronic mats used in previous research studies. In addition, our work will significantly advance the research field by simultaneously measuring, from the same video stream, accurate 3D joint angles, which have recently been shown to be even more specific markers of neurodegeneration compared to footfall parameters. Long Term Goal: All patients will routinely have equal access to advanced gait analytics in primary care practices. By providing a consistent methodology, including integration in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, very large population data will be collected and analyzed to provide new insights into early stages of dementia, discover new functional markers from 3D kinematics, improve diagnostic assessments, and identify new preventive strategies for cognitive decline and risk of falls. Alzheimer’s disease continues to be difficult to predict and diagnose in clinical settings and  while advanced imaging, neuropsychological testing and CSF measures may be available to specialized  clinician investigators involved in research and clinical trials, these are not accessible to  general health care providers. Research has clearly demonstrated that quantitative measures of  gait, not routinely assessed in a clinic, can contribute substantially to identifying older adults  at high risk for transitioning to dementia.  Availability of the GaitIQ motion capture system at a  primary care or geriatric clinic will aid the early identification of older adults who need further  clinical evaluation, supportive treatment and rehabilitative care.",Deep Learning Gait Analytics for Primary Care,9622209,R43AG060855,"['Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Legal patent', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'cohort', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fall risk', 'gait examination', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'primary care setting', 'rehabilitative care', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'software as a service', 'spatiotemporal', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'web services']",NIA,"GAITIQ, LLC",R43,2018,459656,1549244,0.0029598365111677856
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9535033,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,460052,188894159,0.11092197450118309
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9496395,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,618216,641965656,0.15935517233698954
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,338121506,0.12905755768117266
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9339726,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,170236,5678328,0.09469580310999566
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9291398,K08AG048321,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'International', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2017,175103,641965656,0.056529615078802206
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,304670088,0.011930054613392367
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9267094,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,229328,134382703,0.06650674936430828
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9322355,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,246106,560644462,0.03322831875423434
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are

strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use

created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9360318,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,353303,570146095,0.06783711052180873
"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Area Under Curve', 'Awareness', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Geriatrics', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-12', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cost', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'trial comparing']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,327644200,0.049976886920427774
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9382352,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,479151,188894159,0.11092197450118309
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'cohesion', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,136810522,0.10306340087679587
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,338121506,0.12905755768117266
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9222881,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,168375,5678328,0.09469580310999566
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9084484,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2016,175103,641965656,0.056529615078802206
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.        ",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9112221,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,190640,134382703,0.06650674936430828
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,9061560,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2016,197500,246330700,0.0495422098615895
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9144770,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,246106,560644462,0.03322831875423434
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'aging population', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,136810522,0.10306340087679587
"Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit. The disposition plan of patients who visit an ED is to be directly discharged home, placed in observation care, or admitted to the hospital. There is mounting concern that recent increased use of observation care may also subject patients to a rapid diagnostic regiment with unknown utility. As older patients continue to rely on the ED and hospitals for their care, the potential for treatment that is not geriatric-oriented and results in undesirable outcomes shortly after discharge is high. A negative outcome within 7-days of discharge from an acute care encounter is temporally related to the visit and has important policy implications. The goal of this research program is to identify patients at risk for a short-term negative outcome, defined as either an inpatient admission or death, within 7 days of discharge from their acute care encounter. The proposal will utilize a randomly selected sample of 5% Medicare Claims data, which amounts to 2.4 million beneficiaries, of which patients age > 65 years who visit the ED in 2012 will be analyzed. The multi-disciplinary project team includes experts in health services research, geriatrics, emergency medicine, administrative claims data research, and statistics. In Aim 1, the study will assess predictors of ED disposition (discharge or observation care) following the ED visit. The team will then conduct a stratified analysis to identify predictors of negative outcomes following discharge from observation care (Aim 2) or the ED (Aim 3). The proposal will assess the association between two sets of primary predictors, ED discharge diagnosis codes developed by the PI as well as the recently created Medicare Chronic Conditions, and outcomes. Additional variables will include patient demographics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, prior inpatient utilization, skilled nursing facility usage, and community demographics. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, assessment for similarities and collinearity between the predictors, and hierarchical random effects logistic regression models pertaining to each Aim. All project aims have sufficient power to complete the analyses. The proposed study will identify characteristics of patients at risk for negative short-term outcomes following acute care encounters and will (1) provide population-level national data to understand negative outcomes following discharge, (2) serve as a foundation for future work in developing a post-discharge intervention that will reduce these events, and (3) help ED managers, geriatricians, and health policy experts develop national guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Endstage kidney disease, the complete failure of the kidneys, is one of the most pressing medical problems of the developed world. Currently, the best treatment for endstage kidney disease is kidney transplantation, but the number of donor organs are limited, subjecting patients to hemodialysis and in many cases further complications and an early death. We have developed a new method that could be used to grow embryonic kidneys in the laboratory. These kidneys could then be transplanted to support the kidney function of the patient.",Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare,8926346,R03AG047862,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elderly', 'Embryo', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'System', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'demographics', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'male', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2015,91665,673201228,0.029640385619322217

Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.            ",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9026947,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,104080,560644462,0.03322831875423434
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization.

"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,8868661,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2015,237000,246330700,0.0495422098615895
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,136810522,0.10306340087679587
"Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit. The disposition plan of patients who visit an ED is to be directly discharged home, placed in observation care, or admitted to the hospital. There is mounting concern that recent increased use of observation care may also subject patients to a rapid diagnostic regiment with unknown utility. As older patients continue to  rely on the ED and hospitals for their care, the potential for treatment that is not geriatric-oriented and results in undesirable outcomes shortly after discharge is high. A negative outcome within 7-days of discharge from an acute care encounter is temporally related to the visit and has important policy implications. The goal of this research program is to identify patients at risk for a short-term negative outcome, defined as either an inpatient admission or death, within 7 days of discharge from their acute care encounter. The proposal will utilize a randomly selected sample of 5% Medicare Claims data, which amounts to 2.4 million beneficiaries, of which patients age > 65 years who visit the ED in 2012 will be analyzed. The multi-disciplinary project team includes experts in health services research, geriatrics, emergency medicine, administrative claims data research, and statistics. In Aim 1, the study will assess predictors of ED disposition (discharge or observation care) following the ED visit. The team will then conduct a stratified analysis to identify predictors of negative outcomes following discharge from observation care (Aim 2) or the ED (Aim 3). The proposal will assess the association between two sets of primary predictors, ED discharge diagnosis codes developed by the PI as well as the recently created Medicare Chronic Conditions, and outcomes. Additional variables will include patient demographics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, prior inpatient utilization, skilled nursing facility usage, and community demographics. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, assessment for similarities and collinearity between the predictors, and hierarchical random effects logistic regression models pertaining to each Aim. All project aims have sufficient power to complete the analyses. The proposed study will identify characteristics of patients at risk for negative short-term outcomes following acute care encounters and will (1) provide population-level national data to understand negative outcomes following discharge, (2) serve as a foundation for future work in developing a post-discharge intervention that will reduce these events, and (3) help ED managers, geriatricians, and health policy experts develop national guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs and more recently, observation services, employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit and could result in either admission or death within 7 days of discharge. Understanding the characteristics of patients at risk for such outcomes after discharge from the ED or observation care can help improve both ED and follow-up care. Currently, this information is not known. Our study will use national Medicare claims files to identify the patients at risk for these outcomes with the goal of helping improve care for all older adults.",Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare,8749230,R03AG047862,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'System', 'Triage', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'demographics', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'male', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2014,94500,673201228,0.06942045217440128

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8617361,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2014,2047726,136810522,0.10306340087679587
"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.

"Prescription Psychotherapeutic Drug Use Among Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence (not taking drug as prescribed dose) is a significant public health concern. Older adults are frequently prescribed psychotherapeutic drugs including opioids (pain relievers) and central nervous system (CNS) depressants (tranquilizers and sedatives). Older adults are particularly susceptible to adverse medical outcomes from prescription drug abuse, as well as drug interactions due to age-related physiologic changes in body composition and drug metabolism. Negative consequences are even more adverse when older adults abuse more than one type of psychotherapeutic drug or simultaneously use psychotherapeutic drugs and alcohol. However, little is known about risk factors for prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence and the combined use of prescription drug and alcohol. In addition, few screening tools related to drug abuse have been validated in this population. Findings of this study will lead to clinical recommendations for early identification of older adults who may be at risk for psychotherapeutic drugs non-adherence or abuse, relevant to the missions of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The purpose of this study is to describe different patterns of adherence to prescription psychotherapeutic drugs and determine the risk factors of non-adherence among older adults. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) examine the psychometric properties of the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measuring prescription drug adherence among older adults; (2) to describe patterns of adherence to prescription psychotherapeutic drug and combined use of psychotherapeutic drug and alcohol among older adults; and (3) identify risk factors of psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults. This ongoing study is a cross-sectional design. Eligibility criteria include older adults who are 65 or older, taking at least one type of prescription psychotherapeutic drug, and able to communicate. One hundred and fifty participants will be recruited for this study.

The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.              Relevance Statement This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults.

"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6927154,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'communication', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional ability', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'outcomes research', 'pain', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'questionnaires', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2005,150000,0,0.1471290288170612

"JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS This proposal responds to research topic 12 (Cognition in Context), with secondary relevance to topic 19 (Genetics, Behavior and Aging). The aging of the U.S. population has stimulated public health interest in identifying factors that can preserve the cognitive functioning of older adults. Complex work may be one activity that has a salutary effect on late-life cognitive function, but factors like intelligence, educational level, and early environmental exposures are potential confounds to this association. Twin studies allow for control of many of these confounding factors. The goal of this project is to determine whether occupational complexity is associated with better late-life cognitive functioning in a sample of elderly twins, using data collected by the Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging on members of the National Research Council-National Academy of Sciences (NAS-NRC) Registry of World War II veteran twins. Specific Aim 1 of this project is to classify each twin's primary lifetime occupation using the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), from which a measure of complexity can be derived. This allows additional Specific Aims (SA) to be tested using co-twin control analyses: (SA 2) estimate the association between occupational complexity and cognitive status, (SA 3) estimate the association between occupational complexity and change in cognitive status over time, and (SA 4) estimate the extent to which intelligence moderates the relationship between occupational complexity and cognitive status. The study sample, which comprises approximately 1000 monozygotic and 1000 dizygotic twin pairs, has been administered a cognitive status examination every 3-4 years since 1990 as part of a screening and assessment protocol for dementia. Approximately 300 of these pairs also have scores on standard armed services intelligence tests. Logistic regression dependent on twin pair will be used to estimate association between a factor-based measure of occupational complexity from the DOT and either baseline (SA 2) or change scores (SA 3) from the cognitive status measure. Analyses for SA 4 will be similar, using the intelligence test score as a covariate. If occupational complexity is found to enhance late-life cognitive functioning, this modifiable factor could inform cognitive interventions and influence decisions about occupational activities and retirement. Follow-up twin studies can explore whether complex work is a protective factor for dementia. n/a",JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS,6684283,R03AG022683,"['aging', ' clinical research', ' cognition', ' human data', ' human old age (65+)', ' intelligence tests', ' occupations', ' twin /multiplet', ' veterans']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,77000,607172798,0.042012359516822036
