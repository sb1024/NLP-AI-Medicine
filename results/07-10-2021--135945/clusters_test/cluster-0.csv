"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,10075985,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,100000,63611576
"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Family Caregiver', 'Formal caregiver', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Activity', 'Noise', 'Nursing Records', 'Oregon', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging and technology', 'analytical method', 'barometric pressure', 'burnout', 'care providers', 'career', 'caregiver strain', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal caregiver', 'intervention cost', 'memory care', 'motion sensor', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'pressure', 'research and development', 'research study', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'standard of care']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437,304670088
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low-risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary surgical procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care.

"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375,294146927
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213,533302350
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportunity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,10190783,R01AG067416,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2021,292596,6229561
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,10119275,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,470083,83544663
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10134189,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654065,34544143
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10216953,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,796409,558628098
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10261410,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic platform', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'implementation intervention', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,1484783,641965656
"Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged ≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.",Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications,10209375,RF1AG056331,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'European', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guide prevention', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep-focused interventions', 'sociodemographic factors', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,1968065,570146095
"Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY This goal of this project is to create a unique and comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory da- tasets, related resources, and analytic methods that can be used to answer new and important questions in aging and related sciences. Specifically, by harmonizing and merging multiple data sets this project will gener- ate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physi- cal functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels (patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society) and across multiple domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/built environments) including chronic conditions and history of acute illness such as COVID-19, exposure to air pollution, neighbor- hood socioeconomic, and health care system factors (Aim 1). Analytic strategies will be developed for user- defined cohorts and their propensity score-matched controls, e.g., older adults who were living with chronic conditions including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), diabetes, heart failure, end-stage re- nal disease, metastatic cancer, and HIV. State-of-the-art analytic methods are used to identify patterns of ag- ing trajectories (care setting, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning) experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes (Aim 2). From the assem- bled trajectory file in Aim 1, cohorts are derived by aligning an originating index time such as age cutoff point and time at diagnosis (e.g., ADRD, stroke, chronic kidney disease). Both a model-based approach and ma- chine learning algorithms are then used to discover multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajecto- ries (e.g., rapid functional decline in independent living beneficiaries) and specific outcomes (e.g., respiratory ventilator usage among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19) (Aim 3). The unique resources are then shared to disseminate resources including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology (Aim 4). At the end of this project, the research infrastructure to investigate the relationship between shared risk factors and aging trajectories will be ready to use and replicate, giving investigators unprecedented ability to solve new challenges in aging science. This will allow researchers to understand the underlying processes and systems associated with reversible periods of disability across care settings, and interventions that may be used to support recovery of function and reduction of geriatric syndromes including cognitive decline, for the purpose of reducing burdensome care transitions, and maintenance of functional independence. This project will also create the resources and methods needed to evaluate the impact of innovations and interventions im- plemented at the patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society/policy levels to improve care quality and outcomes for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research infrastructure project will harmonize and merge multiple data sets needed to answer new and complex questions about the aging trajectories and health of diverse populations during the universal process of aging. This project will explore the interactions of shared risk factors across levels (patient, provider, com- munity, health care system, and society) and domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/ built environments) using state-of-the-art analytic methods.
