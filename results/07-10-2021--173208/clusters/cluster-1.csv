"Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY: Of the estimated 43,030 patients who will be newly diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2018, a majority will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NAC) to reduce tumor burden. All patients ultimately undergo an aggressive excision of the rectum, of which 25% exhibit complete pathologic response (pCR, i.e. disease- free after NAC) on the post-surgical specimen. These patients have therefore been subjected to an unnecessary, morbid procedure resulting in quality of life issues, in the absence of any definitive, non-invasive biomarkers for NAC response in vivo. While multi-parametric MRI is utilized to pre-operatively assess tumor response and regression to NAC, expert interpretation is confounded and variable due to overlapping appearance of benign treatment effects (e.g. fibrosis, ulceration) and residual tumor.  Recently, more quantitative characterization of lesions has been enabled via radiomics, involving high- throughput, computerized extraction of textural or kinetic attributes from imaging. Radiomic maps of the tumor environment can depict presence of different tissue types based on their structural and functional characteristics, visualized as regions of “low” and ‘high” feature expression. In fact, the post-NAC tumor environment on the excised rectal tissue specimen has been shown to reflect a variety and organization in different pathologic tissue types, also linked to patient prognosis and outcome. However, existing radiomic approaches only attempt to characterize the overall heterogeneity in a tissue region, as they lack “ground truth” to quantify tissue types and their organization on post-NAC MRI. A more comprehensive and accurate predictor for pCR based off multi- parametric MRI could thus be constructed by (a) quantifying the density and arrangement of structural and functional attributes on post-NAC rectal MRIs, and (b) optimizing radiomic descriptors against pathologically validated information of post-NAC tissue types on MRI, via spatial correlation with pathology.  In this proposal, I will develop novel radiomic tools in conjunction with spatially co-localized “ground truth” pathology to build a predictor for identifying rectal cancer patients exhibiting pCR via post-NAC MRI. Aim 1 will involve developing and evaluating a novel radiomic descriptor to quantify spatial organization of morphologic (via structural MRI) and physiologic (via contrast enhancement functional MRI) heterogeneity of the post-NAC lesion environment. Aim 2 will focus on optimizing this radiomic organization descriptor to capture distinctive tissue organization associated with pCR, via spatial mapping of post-surgical pathology information onto pre-operative MRI. My novel descriptor will be evaluated and validated via a machine learning predictor to identify patients exhibiting pCR using a discovery and a hold-out validation cohort, acquired from 2 different institutions; and compared with clinical markers of response. My project will build on promising preliminary results for my radiomic organization descriptor as well as a radiology-pathology co-registration framework, to result in a clinically reliable and impactful radiomics-based tool which could enable personalized management of rectal cancer patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This F31 proposal focuses on novel computational imaging tools for accurate identification and assessment of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation via routine multi- parametric MRI. A comprehensive, quantitative assessment of post-chemoradiation tissue types and their tissue organization on imaging could enable (a) non-invasive identification of complete responders to avoid unneeded and highly morbid surgeries, and (b) more personalized management and follow-up for non-responders to NAC.",Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation,9916627,F31CA216935,"['Appearance', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Colostomy Procedure', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Rectum', 'Residual Tumors', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Sphincter', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'digital pathology', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'in vivo', 'learning classifier', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized management', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,197030888,0.04565557584451738
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,9911574,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,507546965,0.060660880506565935
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9926827,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,507546965,0.06568192779528913
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied.  A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone.  In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10155013,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2020,71260,12032240,0.0940950438883017
"Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics Abstract The diagnosis of primary brain tumors requires a layered approach of histologic, anatomic and molecular features to generate an integrated diagnosis with clinical and prognostic significance. The diagnostic workup of diffuse gliomas in particular requires a panel of immunohistochemical stains with a subset of tumors requiring additional molecular testing to reach a diagnostic category recognized by the World Health Organization. In the United States and worldwide, scarce resources are available to perform these tests, so methods that improve pre-test probabilities and decrease false positive results have significant clinical and financial impact. Our long-term goal is to improve and standardize testing and diagnoses for brain tumor patients worldwide by validating new diagnostic workflows using digital imaging, immunohistochemical tests, open source computing platforms and machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic capabilities. We will achieve these goals by completing three specific aims in this R03 Pilot/Feasibility project. First, we will determine the extent to which predictive diagnostic models developed from public domain data show generalizability to cases evaluated at a tertiary brain cancer care center. We have already generated a prototype statistical predictive model, which we will expand to all CNS tumor types and test with data from patients at James Cancer Hospital. Second, we will generate and validate models that predict the probability of false-positive 1p/19q FISH testing using histological features from OLIG2-immunostained brain tumor slides obtained from whole slide imaging. Lastly, we will consolidate data containing whole slide digital images, immunohistochemical features, clinical data and molecular features of diffuse gliomas. Consolidating these data will allow us to begin data analysis correlating histological images to immunohistochemical and molecular features. This dataset will represent the core dataset that upon which we will base our next R01-level proposal. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team composed of an image analysis expert and neuropathologist (JO), a molecular neuropathologist (DT), and a high dimensionality bioinformaticist (JZ). The Ohio State University is the first US cancer center to transition to complete whole slide imaging, and therefore we are in a unique position to generate a significant, vertical advance in improving diagnostic accuracy in neuropathology with modern Pathology Informatics approaches. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop predictive models of cancer diagnoses and consolidate various forms of patient data into one centralized source for research. This new knowledge will ultimately serve as the framework upon which interventions are designed that may improve morbidity and mortality of patients with primary brain tumors. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disease.",Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics,9954242,R03NS116334,"['19q', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'FDA approved', 'Geographic state', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Ohio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Probability', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'histological image', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic significance', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NINDS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,156000,241268189,0.05165745310505921
"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel genomic and proteomic mechanisms of NRF2 activation in order to advance strategies for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of patients with NRF2 active tumors.",Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,10126595,K08DE029241,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'CDKN2A gene', 'CUL3 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Faculty', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Neurotensin', 'Neurotensin Receptors', 'North Carolina', 'Otolaryngology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Carcinoma', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiosensitization', 'Reading Frames', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Surgeon', 'TP53 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transactivation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'genetic signature', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral HPV-positive head and neck cancers', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'prohormone', 'proneurotensin', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational genomics', 'treatment risk', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K08,2020,173993,511185245,0.05444836877165645
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,9842653,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2020,192240,175892898,0.08610422856024665
"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,9878354,R21CA245597,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast cancer metastasis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Extravasation', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cancer complication', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experience', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,218790,641965656,0.00578122817174627
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms.

"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9917724,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,312511,148186688,0.028541099485278516
"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue. This approach is relevant to public health as it is expected to significantly improve detection and destruction of micromets in ovarian cancer patients, and reduce side effects in normal tissue, thereby fulfilling the overarching goal of improving patients’ survival rates and quality of life.",Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases,10058694,R01CA243164,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biodistribution', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Epithelium', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'FOLR1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Folic Acid', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Laparoscopes', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Liposomal Doxorubicin', 'Liposomes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm to the Ovary', 'Micrometastasis', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodule', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian Carcinoma', 'PUVA Photochemotherapy', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phospholipids', 'Photosensitization', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Phototherapy', 'Physiological', 'Platinum', 'Porphyrins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'anti-cancer', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'contrast enhanced', 'controlled release', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided drug delivery', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intraperitoneal', 'liposome vector', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'nano', 'nanocarrier', 'nanomedicine', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity', 'uptake']",NCI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,340883,5678328,0.025158979802055656
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue. Patient care and clinical decision-making will improve dramatically as a complete picture of histological features underlying brain tumor imaging emerges from this proposal.",Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology,9936429,R01CA218144,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contrast Media', 'Cytology', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress Tests', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor imaging', 'cancer cell', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision-making', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2020,352275,122662885,0.0627297625917492
"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9980817,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visualization', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,374477,43632870,0.055311324413436766
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.

"SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Thermal ablation systems are typically accompanied by ablation treatment planning system to optimize the treatment outcome using pre-operative CT scan. Radiomics is a process of converting medical images into higher-dimensional data and subsequent mining of data to reveal underlying pathophysiology for enhancing clinical decision support making. Radiomics analysis have shown promises in capturing distinct tumor characteristics and predicting prognosis of the tumor. We propose innovative method to calculate microwave ablation zones by supplementing a bioheat transfer model of microwave tissue ablation with microwave sensitive radiomics features, which will generate more accurate and personalized ablation prediction leading to better treatment outcome. Inputs to the bioheat transfer modeling approach include the geometry of the target tumor, physical properties of the tissue, and dimensions of the microwave ablation applicator. The radiomics algorithm extracts properties of the targeted tumor’s size and shape, as well as texture from CT images. Therefore, shape, size, and texture data computed through 3D wavelets are employed as radiomics features for more accurate dose prediction. The proposed radiomics analysis is conducted in three stages: (1)automatic detection of candidate tumors, (2)automatic segmentation of a selected tumor, (3)extraction of features from the segmented tumor, (4)analysis of ablated tumor over period of time. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269839,5N91020C00050,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Image', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'feature extraction', 'innovation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'multidimensional data', 'outcome forecast', 'physical property', 'preclinical study', 'radiomics', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"PHENOMAPPER, LLC",N43,2020,398952,398952,0.09785307642536145
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9968180,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,449186,570146095,-0.017935982394628493
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9987579,R01CA226527,"['American', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histologic', 'Histological Techniques', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical translation', 'college', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'data centers', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'histological image', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'standard of care', 'virtual']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,525328,329565273,0.05152746095946268
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,10000066,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541899,593605914,0.0965357850623951
"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,9973569,R01CA241666,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fingerprint', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune system', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nanostructures', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Silanes', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'Width', 'Woman', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'cancer type', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'early screening', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'multiplex detection', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'nanoscale', 'nanosized', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vesicle transport', 'vesicular release']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,564554,254622553,0.009173825223352881
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,9930060,R01CA234018,"['4T1', 'ATAC-seq', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'CT26', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Exclusion', 'Expression Profiling', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Regulator Genes', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web server']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,591752,174094914,0.051248841057803494
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9951006,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncotype', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,598709,197030888,0.011818172497979434
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9982672,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,601618,550947887,0.12675858933922715
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9827559,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'genomic profiles', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,602872,758431960,0.025707543430900363
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9947900,U01CA225431,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,609531,558628098,0.0328576263109169
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9884742,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,624150,197030888,0.05175699565528091
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9891974,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2020,653673,294146927,0.016434499491340977
"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,9893291,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670422,593605914,0.05739276845902113
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9936120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2020,714132,50305751,0.05845549914804556
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9981696,U01CA214411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic testing', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'side effect', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,742092,327644200,0.08743680772706773
"Developing high-throughput genetic perturbation strategies for single cells in cancer organoids PROJECT SUMMARY  To address the complexity of heterogeneous cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy and frequently recur or metastasize, we propose to develop a set of tools based on multidisciplinary innovations combining Synthetic Biology, Cancer Organoid Technology, and Bioinformatics. These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research. The collective commitment and multidisciplinary contributions of the entire team ensure the establishment of an openly distributed investigative tool set that accelerates advancements in cancer biology and therapeutic discovery PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop a collection of Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) to enable wide adoption of the Next Generation Cancer Models in the cancer research community.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10005896,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2020,952700,12032240,0.0940950438883017
"Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center) SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood. NARRATIVE Construction of Pre-Cancer Atlases comprising detailed spatial and molecular data on cell state and omic data in melanoma and clonal hematopoiesis will join together the two primary means of diagnosing human cancer: histology and genetics. The atlases we construct will help to identify patients with pre-cancer skin lesions and blood conditions at risk of progressing to malignancy at a sufficiently early stage that aggressive disease can be prevented.",Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center),10252281,U2CCA233262,"['Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Histology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Oncologist', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention therapy', 'Prevention trial', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Skin Cancer', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stromal Cells', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'crowdsourcing', 'data acquisition', 'data standards', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep neural network', 'dimensional analysis', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'image visualization', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'laser capture microdissection', 'machine learning method', 'melanoma', 'member', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'prospective', 'skin lesion', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U2C,2020,974841,178569161,0.008465375283648465
"Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY: Of the estimated 43,030 patients who will be newly diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2018, a majority will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NAC) to reduce tumor burden. All patients ultimately undergo an aggressive excision of the rectum, of which 25% exhibit complete pathologic response (pCR, i.e. disease- free after NAC) on the post-surgical specimen. These patients have therefore been subjected to an unnecessary, morbid procedure resulting in quality of life issues, in the absence of any definitive, non-invasive biomarkers for NAC response in vivo. While multi-parametric MRI is utilized to pre-operatively assess tumor response and regression to NAC, expert interpretation is confounded and variable due to overlapping appearance of benign treatment effects (e.g. fibrosis, ulceration) and residual tumor.  Recently, more quantitative characterization of lesions has been enabled via radiomics, involving high- throughput, computerized extraction of textural or kinetic attributes from imaging. Radiomic maps of the tumor environment can depict presence of different tissue types based on their structural and functional characteristics, visualized as regions of “low” and ‘high” feature expression. In fact, the post-NAC tumor environment on the excised rectal tissue specimen has been shown to reflect a variety and organization in different pathologic tissue types, also linked to patient prognosis and outcome. However, existing radiomic approaches only attempt to characterize the overall heterogeneity in a tissue region, as they lack “ground truth” to quantify tissue types and their organization on post-NAC MRI. A more comprehensive and accurate predictor for pCR based off multi- parametric MRI could thus be constructed by (a) quantifying the density and arrangement of structural and functional attributes on post-NAC rectal MRIs, and (b) optimizing radiomic descriptors against pathologically validated information of post-NAC tissue types on MRI, via spatial correlation with pathology.  In this proposal, I will develop novel radiomic tools in conjunction with spatially co-localized “ground truth” pathology to build a predictor for identifying rectal cancer patients exhibiting pCR via post-NAC MRI. Aim 1 will involve developing and evaluating a novel radiomic descriptor to quantify spatial organization of morphologic (via structural MRI) and physiologic (via contrast enhancement functional MRI) heterogeneity of the post-NAC lesion environment. Aim 2 will focus on optimizing this radiomic organization descriptor to capture distinctive tissue organization associated with pCR, via spatial mapping of post-surgical pathology information onto pre-operative MRI. My novel descriptor will be evaluated and validated via a machine learning predictor to identify patients exhibiting pCR using a discovery and a hold-out validation cohort, acquired from 2 different institutions; and compared with clinical markers of response. My project will build on promising preliminary results for my radiomic organization descriptor as well as a radiology-pathology co-registration framework, to result in a clinically reliable and impactful radiomics-based tool which could enable personalized management of rectal cancer patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This F31 proposal focuses on novel computational imaging tools for accurate identification and assessment of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation via routine multi- parametric MRI. A comprehensive, quantitative assessment of post-chemoradiation tissue types and their tissue organization on imaging could enable (a) non-invasive identification of complete responders to avoid unneeded and highly morbid surgeries, and (b) more personalized management and follow-up for non-responders to NAC.",Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation,9683190,F31CA216935,"['Appearance', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Colostomy Procedure', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Rectum', 'Residual Tumors', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Sphincter', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'digital pathology', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'in vivo', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized management', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,197030888,0.04565557584451738
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9638528,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,507546965,0.06568192779528913
"Development of a High-Throughput Three-Dimensional H&E Platform for the Characterization of Breast Cancer Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to develop a prognostic imaging tool for breast cancer that can be used to predict specific clinical outcomes such as tumor reoccurrence and drug resistance based upon a tumor’s histomorphology features. The current histopathology paradigm for evaluating tissues is focused on diagnosing disease wherein these same tissues if evaluated in their entirety and digitized, provide an opportunity to correlate clinical outcomes to specific tissue features. Through this project, we are developing a high- throughput breast tumor imaging approach that is capable of imaging breast tumor tissue in its entirety and generating virtual H&E optical Z sections in 3D of equivalent quality to traditional H&E sections so that all of the cells within a biopsy are characterized. To achieve this objective, we are combining our patented tissue clearing approach with fluorescent labeling, high-content confocal microscopy and an unbiased machine learning approach. This approach allows for biopsies to be digitized in their entirety and for all of the features and heterogeneity of tumors to be assessed instead of just looking at a few ultra-thin 2D slides. Through the combination of this unique imaging approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering, specific histomorphological features can be correlated to clinical outcomes using a detailed sample library with corresponding clinical outcome data. The main objectives of this project are to 1) develop a robust 3D H&E labeling approach, 2) demonstrate that tissues can be imaged in 3D using a fluorescent approach to generate “H&E-like” images of equivalent quality to traditional H&E and 3) show that this tissue analysis approach can be transferred to an automated high- content confocal microscope. Additionally, we will show the ability to cluster tissues based on their histomorphological features and will with a small data set of 34 breast tumor biopsies show how these features are correlated to clinical outcomes. If successful, we will develop this proof-of-concept into a robust CLIA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant assay that complies with the ICH guidelines for analytical assays. This assay would ultimately allow clinicians to better predict how a tumor will respond to certain treatments and best tailor a treatment for a specific patient. This type of precision medicine approach will lead to improved patient outcomes and a more efficacious treatment regimen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop a prognostic imaging tool for breast cancer that evaluates breast tumor tissues in their entirety in 3D and uses a machine learning based approach to predict specific clinical outcomes such as tumor reoccurrence and drug resistance.

To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9895187,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2019,73936,12032240,0.0940950438883017
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9743114,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2019,134632,185946435,0.10313945391570607
"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9771401,R21CA231892,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian learning', 'Brain', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'feature detection', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'member', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel architecture', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'real-time images', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2019,194940,122662885,0.08042305592685692
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9724467,R00EB020749,"['Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atypia', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophotonics', 'Biophysics', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Density', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Frequencies', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Skill', 'Linear Algebra', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical Injuries', 'Surgical Oncology', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Step', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'chemical bond', 'chemical group', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'frontier', 'gray matter', 'human disease', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'meningioma', 'microscopic imaging', 'mouse model', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'peer', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard care', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration', 'white matter']",NIBIB,"STATE UNIVERSITY OF NY,BINGHAMTON",R00,2019,243484,10232543,0.08501527007210981
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9707393,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,313021,148186688,0.028541099485278516
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9827695,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,392987,43632870,0.055311324413436766
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9703925,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,431871,570146095,-0.017935982394628493
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling.

"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9765042,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,530736,593605914,0.0965357850623951
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9747360,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531751,90710179,0.06267402465396522
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9724401,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585112,197030888,0.011818172497979434
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9613231,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'genomic profiles', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,588045,758431960,0.025707543430900363
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9699454,U01CA225431,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'image archival system', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2019,601400,558628098,0.0328576263109169
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9743107,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,605394,550947887,0.12675858933922715
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9663910,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614169,197030888,0.05175699565528091
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9671372,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'actionable mutation', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2019,634586,294146927,0.016434499491340977
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9767744,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2019,651460,12032240,0.0940950438883017
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9743120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2019,692707,50305751,0.05845549914804556
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9756346,U01CA214411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protein B', 'response', 'side effect', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2019,775492,327644200,0.08743680772706773
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING MRI images have been used for a wide variety of medical applications for a long time because they are safe and highly sensitive at detecting of tissue abnormalities that indicate cancer. MRI is generated by measuring the response of tissue components to a magnetic field. Also, based on the published statistics, brain tumor is one of the most common causes of death and early detection and monitoring is crucial for treatment. Literature and market review suggests that although extensive research exists on brain tumor detection using MRI images, MRI–based systems designed for brain tumor detection that have ultimate clinical value and use are lacking. Accordingly, we propose a new software technology that effectively detect, segment, classify and monitor brain tumor in MRI images. There have been extensive efforts on brain tumor detection in MR images because early detection has been always crucial for success of treatment. For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods that for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment. If successful, the proposed software technology in this project may potentially be the first that may be commercialized for brain tumor segmentation and classification on MRI images.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING,9706156,R01EB020683,"['Brain Neoplasms', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'magnetic field', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'statistics', 'success']",NIBIB,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,46500,3981236,0.06147213218280449
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9444495,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,49524,507546965,0.06568192779528913
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9582884,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2018,134632,185946435,0.10313945391570607
"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients.

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.

"Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and is characterized with dismal odds due to advanced disease at late stage diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 7% for patients with non-resectable disease (~80% of patients), to ~23% for patients with resectable tumors (< 20%of patients). PDAC, like most solid tumors, is highly hypoxic, resulting from both poor oxygen delivery due to leaky and chaotic vasculature and increased oxygen consumption due to high metabolic activity. This makes drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment more difficult and often ineffective. In the past 40 years, only marginal improvements in complete response (CR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) have occurred despite the development of a number of promising chemotherapy, or chemoradiation regimens. New and improved therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve the treatment of this disease. Mild hyperthermia (HT) in the range of 39-42°C has shown to improve blood flow to tumors, enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Numerous randomized clinical trials have shown to provide CR, PFS, OR and QoL benefits but implementation in clinical practice has been lagging due to the inability to provide safe, quantifiable and controlled therapeutic thermal dose through accurate temperature monitoring. NTO has designed and built the VectronTTx device which can effectively deliver heat non-invasively in deep tissue without causing skin burns or excessive fat heating (the most common adverse effect encountered with current technologies) without the need for a cooling mechanism such as a water bolus that is a frequent cause for interrupted treatments due to patient discomfort. The heating elements of the device are integrated into an applicator with magnetic resonance (MR) transmit and receive channels to allow for real-time MR thermometry imaging (MRTI) measurements. In this Phase I proposal, we will develop novel MRTI methodologies that significantly improve the state-of-the-art by accurately measuring temperature over HT treatment time scales (30-60 minutes) in an abdominal environment compensating for interfering processes including field drift and motion-induced field variations. We will also develop a treatment- modeling architecture that combines virtual models, patient-specific features, and an artificial intelligence (AI)- based architecture to create extrapolated patient-specific treatment plans. Upon successful completion of Phase I and validation of the developed real-time MRTI monitoring techniques, we will develop methods in Phase II for accurate measurements of temperature in fat by incorporating interleaved or hybrid fat-based techniques into the field-corrected MRTI sequences. In phase II, we will also develop and implement the infrastructure to perform personalized treatment planning. This treatment planning will be based on conventional image transformations, conventional EM-solving, and AI learning of thermal sink and tissue properties. Numerous clinical trials have shown that mild hyperthermia in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy is a promising strategy to treat cancer. However, adoption in the clinic will require the ability to measure temperature in the heated regions both for safety and to verify tumor heating. NeoTherma Oncology (NTO) has developed a device that can heat tumors non-invasively within a Magnetic Resonance scanner (MR), which will allow the MR to be used to map temperatures inside the body. In this proposal, NTO and the University of Utah will develop MR methods that will provide accurate and precise measurement of temperature in near real-time, allowing evaluation of this device for clinical use.",Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging,9623256,R43CA233401,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Burn injury', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heating', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperthermia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resectable', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Thermometry', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'design', 'dosage', 'experience', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'respiratory', 'standard of care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual']",NCI,"NEOTHERMA ONCOLOGY, INC.",R43,2018,299014,0,0.038372278029268965
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9487202,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'early screening', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2018,347700,26652155,0.049530698330777355
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9605321,R37CA232209,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2018,445227,570146095,-0.017935982394628493
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides2. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens5-7, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9498251,R01CA226527,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histologic', 'Histological Techniques', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical translation', 'college', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'histological image', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'standard of care', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,529945,641965656,0.05152746095946268
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9525436,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,541146,90710179,0.06267402465396522
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9547124,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,552250,593605914,0.0965357850623951
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9512832,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,608223,197030888,0.011818172497979434
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9523248,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634276,550947887,0.12675858933922715
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9482506,U01CA225431,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'image archival system', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2018,644727,558628098,0.0328576263109169
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9446810,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'genomic profiles', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,647099,758431960,0.025707543430900363
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9543057,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,671111,197030888,0.05175699565528091
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9577958,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2018,737882,50305751,0.05845549914804556
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9564081,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2018,929069,12032240,0.0940950438883017
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center) SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood. NARRATIVE Construction of Pre-Cancer Atlases comprising detailed spatial and molecular data on cell state and omic data in melanoma and clonal hematopoiesis will join together the two primary means of diagnosing human cancer: histology and genetics. The atlases we construct will help to identify patients with pre-cancer skin lesions and blood conditions at risk of progressing to malignancy at a sufficiently early stage that aggressive disease can be prevented.",Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center),9627416,U2CCA233262,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Histology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Oncologist', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention therapy', 'Prevention trial', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Skin Cancer', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stromal Cells', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'crowdsourcing', 'data acquisition', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep neural network', 'dimensional analysis', 'genetic analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'image visualization', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'laser capture microdissection', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'member', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'prospective', 'repository', 'skin lesion', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U2C,2018,6918530,178569161,0.008465375283648465
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9312109,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,49044,507546965,0.06568192779528913
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health.

"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM. This approach could also be applied to other human cancers.",Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas,9321295,R21CA209345,"['19q', 'Achievement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligo (dT)', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,165732,367414121,0.03719669574492019
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Infiltration of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain make curative surgical resection of GBM impossible, and almost all will eventually recur. Thus, extraordinary significance is placed on radiation therapy (RT) strategies, which have been shown to be effective, but require strong imaging evidence to guide RT planning. Currently employed clinical imaging modalities include T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, which only identifies leaky neovasculature associated with high grade tumor, and T2-weighted MRI, which is not specific for tumor infiltration. Through advances in neurosurgery, it is now possible to achieve complete or near-complete resection of the CE tumor component in many cases; thus, the region that is treated with the highest RT dose is limited to the empty resection cavity plus a small margin. Due to the generally larger size of the T2 area and unknown status of disease, it is treated to a lesser “microscopic disease” dose. Many times, however, this microscopic disease dose is inadequate to control the tumor. Spectroscopic MR imaging (sMRI) provides a highly sensitive and specific means of identifying these regions, although sMRI has not yet seen use in RT planning due to a lack of clinical decision support software for the analysis, display, and management of sMRI data. Three key hurdles to be overcome are: 1) lack of an automatic, fast and reliable method for spectral quality control; 2) the necessity of quantification of metabolite levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism; and 3) a clinician- friendly display of the sMRI spectra encoded as a high-resolution, continuous, 3D image set for direct registration and incorporation into the RT planning process. Currently, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and shepherding data between several tools, resulting in a complex workflow that takes hours and is impractical for routine use in a fast-paced clinical RT environment. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to radiation oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in RT planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning. Specifically, we will develop algorithmic filters for identifying (and eliminating) spectral artifacts, algorithms for personalized localization of tumor infiltration, and methods and interfaces for the volumetric display of sMRI data needed for RT planning and review. Success in the proposed work will produce an automated “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into routine clinical applications. This tool will also be highly valuable in the MRS-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative There is widespread agreement that MR spectroscopy can provide valuable information without the need for exogenous contrast agents, however the software tools needed to incorporate whole brain 3D spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) into clinical practice are lacking. We plan to develop a web-based sMRI clinical interface for the analysis, visualization and integration of sMRI data into patient management. This “scanner-to-clinician” platform is designed to provide quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis in order to integrate sMRI into the routine radiation therapy planning process. In addition, this user-friendly tool will be highly valuable in the sMRI-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies aside from cancer, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface,9332618,R21NS100244,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Surgically-Created Resection Cavity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Water', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'neovasculature', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,233258,507546965,0.04140321340493014
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation).

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,26652155,0.049530698330777355
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9349466,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,542768,593605914,0.0965357850623951
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9333447,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,544581,90710179,0.06267402465396522
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9256441,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,548074,641965656,0.04014803422556196
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9305968,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,624988,197030888,0.011818172497979434
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9314557,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,644766,550947887,0.12675858933922715
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9389124,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2017,716510,12032240,0.0940950438883017
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9191930,F30CA206291,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'histological image', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2016,43576,507546965,0.06568192779528913
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM.

"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). The successful validation of msCHIP could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS,9037632,R21CA195152,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellularity', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease heterogeneity', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'histological image', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,201504,197030888,0.02461672883481145
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation).

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,26652155,0.049530698330777355
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9150339,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,547736,90710179,0.06267402465396522
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9067256,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,549985,641965656,0.04014803422556196
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9194067,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'genomic tools', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,562825,593605914,0.0965357850623951
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9186255,R01CA206180,"['Accounting', 'Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,669786,550947887,0.12675858933922715
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9176586,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,699670,197030888,0.011818172497979434
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). The successful validation of msCHIP could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.            ",Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS,8880748,R21CA195152,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellularity', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'MME gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,186341,197030888,0.02461672883481145
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation).

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,26652155,0.049530698330777355
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8849399,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,554150,641965656,0.04014803422556196
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9037783,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,572285,90710179,0.06267402465396522
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment.

"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context,8716702,K99CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K99,2014,138712,199779478,0.14239601509772024
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity     DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8620732,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2014,219825,12032240,0.09328874539452417
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.            ",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8697721,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,501194,641965656,0.04014803422556196

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds.

"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.            ",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8526929,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PC3 cell line', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F32,2013,53942,227555357,-0.02776107068014518
"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.     Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.     Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.        The written critiques and criteria scores of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in the ""Critique"" section below.

"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8490147,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2013,305251,12032240,0.09328874539452417
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8473174,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,421339,593605914,0.12519660491745238
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes.

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations', 'Acinar Cell Carcinoma', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma', 'Adenolymphoma', 'Basic Science', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of salivary gland', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Parotid Cancer', 'Parotid Gland', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent Model', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Salivary Glands', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'abstracting', 'adenoma', 'antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'insight', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2012,211387,673201228,0.060660942965641236
"A Predictive Prognostic Model for Glioblastoma Multiforme     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, almost half of all diagnosed primary brain tumors in the United States are Grade IV glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs). While recent efforts have begun to uncover the genetic pathways involved in this cancers etiology and potential methods for treatment arguably, no specific prognostic model has arisen (and been sufficiently validated) to provide widespread usability and individually tailored predictions about a patients prognosis, let alone suggest optimal treatment. The objective of this proposal is the development of a Bayesian belief network (BBN) for predicting outcomes for GBM patients. This research effort first looks to validate a BBN developed using two NIH datasets: the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Rembrandt Project; and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Working with our clinical investigators, we will develop a BBN topology for representing GBMs and compute the required conditional probabilities from these public resources. Model variables will encompass the full spectrum of available observations (demographics, initial presentation, histopathology, treatment, imaging, performance scores, end outcomes, etc.).This Rembrandt-TCGA BBN will then be evaluated against conventional statistical models (e.g., multivariate logistic regression, Cox proportional-hazards regression) to assess predictions of time to prognosis and time to survival. Next, we will compare the Rembrandt-TCGA BBN¿s performance against two new and unseen populations at UCLA and the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration (GLA-VA); this assessment will inform to what extent the nationally-derived BBN can be applied to different GBM populations at other institutions. We also investigate the extension of the Rembrandt-TCGA BBN to add site-specific variables in order to improve prognostic predictions, including symptoms, sequelae, and additional quantitative imaging findings. Informatics-driven tools from our past work in neuro-oncology and image processing will be leveraged to assist with information extraction tasks needed to map UCLA and GLA-VA patient records to site-specific BBNs. Patient- specific models for the UCLA and GLA-VA GBM patients will also be explored using Lazy Bayes Rules to improve modeling and predictive accuracy. The BBNs will also be extended to capture temporal information, resulting in a dynamic belief network (DBN) that represents specific phases of the cancer's evolution and treatment. A graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the various belief network models, aiding in medical decision-making tasks. The proposed GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information, compute the probabilities associated with specified outcomes, and provide a method for similar case-based retrieval. The ultimate result of this endeavor will be a set of tools and well-validated disease model to provide more tailored information and guidance to physicians about GBM patient outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Grade IV brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are responsible for a significant number of cancer-related deaths each year. Recent progress in understanding the contributing factors to brain tumor development at the genetic level, its presentation and response to treatment at the imaging level, and improved knowledge of the interplay of chemotherapeutic and other interventions now provide a unique opportunity to create a comprehensive disease model that can aid in medical decision-making tasks. The focus of this research is the creation of a Bayesian belief network for GBMs, using the array of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem to provide better predictions about survival outcomes and to develop tools that can help guide physicians with medical decisions regarding treatment options.                  Grade IV brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are responsible for a significant number of cancer-related deaths each year.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8271303,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,447222,593605914,0.12519660491745238

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,8019130,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical material', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'theranostics', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2011,783061,0,0.05312580452995694
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Multiresolution-fractal modeling for brain tumor detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI's long-term research goal is to develop a fully functional automated robust CAD tool for accurate  pediatric brain tumor volume segmentation and tracking over time. Note the current practice in brain tumor  volume segmentation involves manual tracing and segmentation of suspected tumor areas in multimodality MRI  which is time consuming, labor intensive, and may be imprecise.  In an effort to reduce cognitive sequelae, contemporary protocols employ risk-adapted therapy in which risk  stratification is based on volume of residual tumor after surgical resection and presence of metastatic disease at  diagnosis. Therefore, further improvement in cancer treatment outcome in children is unlikely to be achieved  without improved knowledge of tumor volume and classification among other factors. In addition, such automated  volume computation and tracking tool would be of value as an adjunct marker in following up patients with brain  tumors. This will, in turn, help the physicians to make important patient management decisions about surgery  planning, critical radiation treatment planning modifications, treatment field modifications, localized control, sites  of metastatic disease and post therapy response evaluation.  However, development of such automated and precise tumor volume segmentation CAD tool requires solution to  a few challenges such as detection of hard-to-detect brain tumor (small residual after surgery, poorly  enhanced, multi foci and irregularly shaped) and abnormalities (edema, necrosis, and larger resection  cavity due to surgery) detection and classification. This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation  of innovative techniques and tools that will assist feature-based detection, segmentation and classification of  brain tumor and a few specific abnormalities.} The specific aims of this project are: 1) Spline-multiresolution  wavelet-fractal feature extraction; 2) MR sequence-dependant feature fusion and tumor/abnormality size and  volume determination for improved detection; 3) Optimized feature fusion for improved tumor, tissue and  abnormality classification; and 4) Algorithm testing and validation. {If successful, our method will allow for the  automatic computation of brain tumors and abnormalities with improved accuracy, which can provide a rapid,  objective, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the disease. The results obtained from this project will  have immediate impact in pediatric neuroradiology practice by providing an accurate, objective, and consistent  way to evaluate and interpret brain tumors and associated abnormalities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation of novel feature-based algorithms for robust, accurate  and reproducible brain tumor and other abnormalities detection and classification.

"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy. Improvements in tumor volume assessment are important for treatment planning as well as for assessing response during clinical drug trials.            Project Narrative  The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR. Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           n/a",Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors,7903971,R01CA112215,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies', 'Biliary', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Community Hospitals', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Adenocarcinoma', 'Metastatic Lesion', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'bile duct', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'performance site', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.

Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,7767720,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical material', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2010,913767,0,0.05312580452995694
"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors PROVIDED.  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have  ¿ecently demonstratedthe feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally  imited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real  ime quantitative PCR.

"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy. Improvements in tumor volume assessment are important for treatment planning as well as for assessing response during clinical drug trials.            Project Narrative  The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple  molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of  clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine,  which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific  patients.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis.

Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           n/a",Chip Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors,7477718,R01CA112215,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies', 'Appendix', 'Biliary', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Community Hospitals', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genus Cola', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Adenocarcinoma', 'Metastatic Lesion', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Numbers', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'bile duct', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gene discovery', 'improved', 'performance site', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Optical surveillance of tumor margins in patients undergoing breast conserving su    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2005, 72,000 women that underwent breast surgery had to have a second re-excision surgery due to incomplete removal of the cancer during the first surgery. Needing a second surgery means increased cancer recurrence, patient anxiety, complications, and cost. Currently, surgeons have no readily available, cost efficient, intraoperative instruments that ensure that the cancer has been completely excised to prevent re-excision. To improve care, surgeons are seeking real time information on the tumor margins at the site of excision. Prior intraoperative solutions (frozen section and cytology) to prevent re-excision have not been adopted because they required a pathologist in the O.R., take too long during surgery, and only examine less than 1% of the tumor margin. Our long-term objective is to develop a chemically specific and quantitative multi-channel optical assay device for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy). The optical device will provide non-destructive evaluation of approximately 80% of the tumor margin in the excised specimen (as opposed to 1% provided by touch prep or frozen section); require no specialized personnel or sample processing (cutting and staining); and will require considerably less time than conventional techniques. The goal of the work is to design, fabricate and evaluate a single- channel alpha version of the optical assay device that will provide point measurements, and conduct a pilot clinical study on ex vivo breast tissues to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our novel technology. The specific aims are to: (1) design and optimize a single-channel optical device using Monte Carlo simulations; (2) build an alpha prototype device based on the simulations, and (3) validate the device's performance against a standard bench- top optical system on synthetic breast tissue phantoms, and determine the sensitivity and specificity on excised human breast tissue specimens in a pilot clinical study. Concurrent with this effort, we are recruiting expertise in management, regulatory and reimbursement strategies so that we will be well positioned to bring this device to market following completion of the R&D program. This device will have significant clinical benefits including: (1) reduced repeat surgeries and hence, reduced local recurrence, (2) reduced tissue removal, which translates to cosmetically-superior lumpectomies at the time of the first surgery, (3) reduced emotional distress, (4) reduced complications due to reduced number of surgeries and shorter recovery times for the patient and (5) reduced cost for the patient and the healthcare system. Successful completion of this project will set the foundation for the development of a fast, multi-pixel optical assay system for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. The optical assay system will have significant clinical benefits including: (1) reduced re-excision rates, (2) reduced tissue removal, which translates to cosmetically-superior lumpectomies at the time of the first surgery, (3) better margin assessment leading to reduced repeat surgeries and hence, reduced local recurrence, (4) reduced emotional distress, and (5) reduced complications due to reduced number of surgeries and shorter recovery times for the patient.          n/a",Optical surveillance of tumor margins in patients undergoing breast conserving su,7270954,R41CA128160,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Breast', 'Breast-Conserving Surgery', 'Caliber', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Cytology', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Device', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Non-Malignant', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Solutions', 'Specimen', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lumpectomy', 'breast surgery', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer surgery', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'desire', 'detector', 'emotional distress', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrument', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'new technology', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'simulation', 'tissue phantom', 'tumor']",NCI,"ZENALUX BIOMEDICAL, INC.",R41,2007,195843,0,-0.03348737894045153
"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,7298872,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Localized', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'commercialization', 'day', 'design', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2007,227868,0,0.05312580452995694
"COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING The overall goal is to optimize the design of medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms for the purposes of tumor detection in humans and animals.

"Direct MALDI-ToF analysis of LCM-selected tissue & tumor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to improve the quality of differential cancer diagnostics and metastatic tumor origination using protein and carbohydrate biomarker detection of patient biopsies, BioAnalyte Inc. and collaborators at MGH and JHMI propose to develop laser capture microdissection (LCM) as a sample preparation system for the biomolecular profiling capabilities of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The work will first optimize protocols for collecting cells from mammalian tissue for MALDI-ToF analysis. For differential diagnostics we will analyze several LCM-selected cells from the tumor collection at MGH representing a variety of cancers will be used to determine the MALDI-ToF profiles of transformed and adjoining normal tissue. For identification of a metastatic tumor with its primary, we will make MALDI-ToF MS profiles of LCM-selected cells from metastatic cancers and compare them to profiles of LCM-selected cells in the original tissue.

"TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality       in men and women in the United States, and the overall long-term survial is      less than 15%.  Pathologic stage I makes up  25-35% of NSCLC cases and has       a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is      35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of           several localized solid tumors after resection and may prove to be useful        in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this            project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage       I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I           NSCLC was chosen for study to eliminate the significant influence of             positive lymph nodes and distant metastases on survival.                         Immunohistochemical staining will identify potential tissue tumor markers        and radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will       identify potential serum tumor markers.                                                                                                                           Specific aim #1 will examine a set of twelve tissue tumor markers in a           retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                 categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers          (Kras, erbB-1, erbB-2, rb, p53, bcl-2), markers of metastatic propensity         (angiogenesis factor viii), proliferation markers (K1-67) and markers of         cellular differentiation (Blood group A, H/LeV/LeB, NCAM, CD44).  Results        will be used to develop a prediction rule for recurrence in stage I NSCLC        using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and an artificial neural      network.                                                                                                                                                          Specific aim #2 will examine a set of eight serum tumor markers in a             retrospective cohort of 250 patients with stage I to IV NSCLC.  These            markers are categorized as molecular genetic markers (anti-p53), markers of      metastatic propensity (angiogenesis bFGF), somatamedins (growth factor IGF-      1) and markers of cellular differentiation (CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3, CYFRA21-       1, CD44).  The purpose of this aim is to identify any correlations between       titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred         patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor                resection.  This subgroup of serum will allow analyses of titters before         and after cyto-reduction.  Significant correlates with tumor stage and mass      will be evaluated in a prospective cohort of patients with stage I NSCLC.                                                                                         In specific aim #3, paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tumor tissue will be      collected from a prospective cohort of 330 patients with stage I NSCLC to        validate the prediction rule developed in specific aim #1.  In these same        patients, serial serum specimens will be collected for a minimum of 2.0          years after resection (specific aim #4).  The significant markers                identified in specific aim #2 will be analyzed in this cohort to describe        correlations with tumor recurrence.  Tissue and serum markers identified by      the model can be used to select high risk patients for a prospective,            multi-institutional chemotherapy trial for stage I NSCLC.                         n/a",TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE,6172943,R29CA073980,"['angiogenesis factor', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' cell differentiation', ' clinical research', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' genetic markers', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' immunocytochemistry', ' insulinlike growth factor', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' metastasis', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer', ' prognosis', ' respiratory surgery', ' serology /serodiagnosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2000,105136,607172798,0.03484534824413704

Of particular interest is the role of redundant data and null functions of the imaging system in the deterministic and statistical properties of the reconstruction algorithms.  n/a",COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING,6165674,K01CA087017,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' performance', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K01,2000,117073,161094826,0.06196467616803182
