"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,324592664,0.009018912338432657
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID Â·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the publicâs health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIHâs investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,9952803,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,92359,570146095,0.02001447265780234
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the toolsâ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humansâ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,9946780,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,150000,178185562,-0.004821164932790921
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to âbig dataâ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new âbig dataâ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,533302350,-0.007466401733712548
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary â Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative â Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiryâ¦and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,66720547,0.02125916979203237
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9928452,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2020,192552,169622494,0.016611999729926732
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimerâs Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimerâs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimerâs Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9982966,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimerâs disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'big-data science', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'visual tracking']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2020,202463,117374875,0.0061302094179480045
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in âunselectedâ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individualsâ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of âunfilteredâ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9995592,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'social structure', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,211875,415711940,0.0038543140226027636
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in todayâs classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support studentsâ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,981500,0.029582661783445128
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID Â·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and childrenâs cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and childrenâs cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and childrenâs environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with childrenâs test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,558628098,-0.0034680255818022375
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This âPathway to Independenceâ award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position.

"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imagingâto better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Centerâs mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and OâBrien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn OâBrien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan.

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) ârule learningâ, which abstracts the underlying ârulesâ by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,148186688,0.01364188033927078
"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6Â±1.5 mm (meanÂ±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9884770,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,388626,77336088,0.004542766463749901
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,43632870,0.016519508278712357
"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges.

"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involvedâmachine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physiciansâthose poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10099785,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,429327,560644462,0.017246032389282254
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,560644462,0.014426830412980948
"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiï¬cance and conï¬dence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ï¬rst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workï¬ow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,533302350,0.02386228247545192
"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasksânot computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'news', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prototype', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,292134808,0.008181214498157008
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA âLeveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.â The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (âomics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the âomics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimerâs Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'âsome limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness. HEALTH RELEVANCE The sense of smell plays a critical role in preferences and aversions for specific foods. The proposed research will combine machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to create a model that can predict the smell of odorous molecules. This model will allow us to describe and control odors, which will increase our understanding of food preference and eating-related health and wellness.",Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure,9887973,R01DC017757,"['Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numerical value', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'computer monitor', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in silico', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'novel', 'physical property', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'preference', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'single molecule', 'visual stimulus']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,2020,496911,6406933,-0.03460754260994298
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9952129,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,501996,340417756,0.018642007621687152
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9934294,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,543993,551214295,0.007314468438213499
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,9935719,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2020,599090,340417756,0.0017387630470479152
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9941090,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,605875,560644462,0.027031034064393604
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language.

"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimerâs Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimerâs. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimerâs Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimerâs Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimerâs-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimerâs Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,9970009,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,649026,551214295,-0.06569939497057442
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model âexecutablesâ are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,10016297,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,673491,673201228,0.008833015886024921
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as âdifficultyâ and âdiscriminationâ within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9920211,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,709525,593605914,-0.01247976777431692
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in todayâs classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support studentsâ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9970958,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,750000,981500,0.02513868130250206
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) â herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'structured data', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,524978793,0.015384773568470832
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary â Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative â Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer. The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification at UC Davis will use advanced experimental and computational mass spectrometry methods to significantly improve compound identification rates in metabolomics.

"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKCâs mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKCâs federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a âCenter cultureâ wherein research and discovery permeates the VKCâs broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRCâs work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHDâs vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected peopleâs and their caregiverâs lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Centerâs Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbiltâs research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individualâs precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,377931988,-0.011497764754806352
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (âomics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the âomics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimerâs Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this âomics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to âbig dataâ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new âbig dataâ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,533302350,-0.007466401733712548
"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine â the integration of âbig dataâ using data science in order to achieve âprecision healthâ â what could be summed up as âdata science of the futureâ. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of âprecision medicineâ as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. âBig Dataâ using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning).

"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease.

"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimerâs Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimerâs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimerâs Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimerâs disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,117374875,0.0061302094179480045

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2019,215352,178569161,0.019985421738931978
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in todayâs classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support studentsâ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,981500,0.02513868130250206
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and childrenâs cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and childrenâs cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and childrenâs environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with childrenâs test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,558628098,-0.0034680255818022375
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This âPathway to Independenceâ award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis,9742424,R00AR070902,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'multidimensional data', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R00,2019,249000,685608202,0.026976322306549175
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID Â·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access.

"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in âunselectedâ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individualsâ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of âunfilteredâ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9827207,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2019,254250,415711940,0.0038543140226027636
"ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the longitudinal structural data we are already analyzing. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for the longitudinal structural imaging data of Aim 2. Longitudinal imaging data are particularly significant, as any differences we find in the evolution of brain structure over time across subgroups supports the notion that the subgroups have distinct natural histories, which in turn goes a long way towards the provocative conclusion that these subgroups of âAlzheimer's diseaseâ represent distinct conditions. Machine learning approaches to these data were not envisioned in the initial proposal, but represent a particularly valuable complementary approach that may identify similarities and differences in trajectories of the evolution of brain structure that would not be apparent using the more traditional analytic pipelines we outlined in the proposal. This then is the perfect fit for an Administrative Supplement â this is an opportunity to enhance the value of the parent study by adding new expertise to investigate in a complementary and valuable fashion a question that was already addressed by the parent grant. This Supplement builds on the same infrastructure and questions asked in Aim 2, but augments our analytical armamentarium with novel machine learning approaches. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672,  'ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups. This proposal would add machine learning approaches for the longitudinal structural imaging data to the analytic strategies already being pursued by the investigators.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9702876,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,328340,641965656,0.04069824696425287
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) ârule learningâ, which abstracts the underlying ârulesâ by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,148186688,0.01364188033927078
"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6Â±1.5 mm (meanÂ±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9637403,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,388812,77336088,0.004542766463749901
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,560644462,0.014426830412980948
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9760006,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,501996,340417756,0.018642007621687152
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9750274,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,543993,551214295,0.007314468438213499
"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efï¬- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiï¬c premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efï¬cient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiï¬c hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ï¬ndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,507546965,0.009350368471092085
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language.

"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9713512,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,647706,560644462,0.027031034064393604
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model âexecutablesâ are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,9712304,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,657823,673201228,0.008833015886024921
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as âdifficultyâ and âdiscriminationâ within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9737676,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,804907,593605914,-0.01247976777431692
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) â herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,524978793,0.015384773568470832
"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and childrenâs cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and childrenâs cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and childrenâs environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with childrenâs test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9517056,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2018,98444,415711940,-0.0034680255818022375
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9523223,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144298,607172798,0.05712432836840668
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9521378,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adult obesity', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2018,155914,58406802,0.05937000400082805
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimerâs Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimerâs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimerâs Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,117374875,0.0061302094179480045
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2018,220530,178569161,0.019985421738931978
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and childrenâs cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and childrenâs cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and childrenâs environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with childrenâs test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9761612,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2018,247463,558628098,-0.0034680255818022375
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This âPathway to Independenceâ award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9511925,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,328340,641965656,0.04069824696425287
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) ârule learningâ, which abstracts the underlying ârulesâ by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas.

"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6Â±1.5 mm (meanÂ±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9455331,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,388993,77336088,0.004542766463749901
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9422606,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,451650,511185245,-0.028723522367946036
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging âpredictionâ studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple âcorrelationâ relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,5898658,0.006942091863067353
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,560644462,0.014426830412980948
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9522037,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,536041,338121506,0.004035682236260797
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (âomics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the âomics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimerâs Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,340417756,0.018642007621687152
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9594591,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,561118,551214295,0.007314468438213499
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This âPathway to Independenceâ award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis,9385849,K99AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2017,94041,685608202,0.02945303420910807
"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and childrenâs cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and childrenâs cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and childrenâs environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with childrenâs test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and childrenâs health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,415711940,-0.0034680255818022375
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,607172798,0.05712432836840668
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9528113,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2017,155914,58406802,0.05937000400082805
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,223908,560644462,0.014426830412980948

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,178569161,0.019985421738931978
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9275549,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,330348,641965656,0.04069824696425287
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9213309,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,451650,511185245,-0.028723522367946036
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,338121506,0.004035682236260797
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (âomics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the âomics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimerâs Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this âomics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9239538,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,36936,228951281,0.05937000400082805
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9270103,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2016,43143,338121506,0.03364857806162986

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9147601,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2016,49355,551214295,0.019985421738931978
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,68981,560644462,0.06410727451458723

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,607172798,0.05712432836840668
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9096792,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,155914,228951281,0.05937000400082805
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",9132357,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'study characteristics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2016,172209,45209062,0.03145086359468926
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9134899,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,334212,641965656,0.04069824696425287
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9058040,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,451650,511185245,-0.028723522367946036
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9145227,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'international partnership', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,539889,338121506,0.004035682236260797

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8935748,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2015,73173,338121506,0.03364857806162986
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8935820,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,146944,607172798,0.05712432836840668
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8935814,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2015,155674,228951281,0.05937000400082805
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.            ","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",8873743,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web-based social networking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2015,203059,45209062,0.03145086359468926
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.                ",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9044227,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Computational Science', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2015,230806,551214295,0.019985421738931978
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.            ",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9004826,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,319087,641965656,0.04069824696425287
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.            ",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,8814543,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,477101,511185245,-0.028723522367946036
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,338121506,0.004035682236260797

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8774800,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2014,73173,338121506,0.03364857806162986
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,607172798,0.05712432836840668
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research     DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.            ",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8828979,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2014,155674,228951281,0.05937000400082805
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs.

"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7798636,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,35821,148186688,0.020209728333208853
"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7760038,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2010,54367,91740242,0.012766943601051116
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. Benchmarks will be established to emphasize the direct competitive teasting of competing hypotheses from alternative theoretical and methodological positions. n/a",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,7813998,R01HD051698,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Child', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'digital', 'disability', 'lexical', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,223419,30434536,-0.040488496253245576
"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Machine Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of Bacterial Pathogens  using Laser Light Scattering  PIs: Dr. M.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7581008,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2009,51103,91740242,0.012766943601051116
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7688793,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2008,58299,570146095,0.02938138470605306

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7458835,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2008,503603,570146095,0.02938138470605306
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,148186688,0.020209728333208853
"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,16827427,0.008862486710733763
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. Benchmarks will be established to emphasize the direct competitive teasting of competing hypotheses from alternative theoretical and methodological positions. n/a",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,7265230,R01HD051698,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Series', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'digital', 'disability', 'lexical', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,234683,30434536,-0.040488496253245576

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This project has a sizeable commercialization potential.  Medical schools and university  neuroscience courses from a significant market.  Moreover the technologies to be   developed are transferable to other domains in the natural and social sciences, business  and medicine.  The technologies used are appropriate for use in distance learning programs,  and can be used by individuals to educate themselves.                                                                                     n/a",Educational Tools for Neuroscience,6403961,R43MH065842,"['computer assisted instruction', ' computer simulation', ' educational resource design /development', ' interactive multimedia', ' neurobiology', ' science education']",NIMH,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2001,100000,0,0.018581699990281673
