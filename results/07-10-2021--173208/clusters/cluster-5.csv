"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,9989245,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,593605914,0.1449280271786173
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10164894,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100356,6676095,0.1176386162959809
"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9868886,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'de-immunization', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2020,188164,80786674,0.08272174498286482
"Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry The identification and quantification of biological macromolecules remains challenging despite major advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition, fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on- the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins, enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.  Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart disease and neurodegeneration.",Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry,10081127,R43GM139467,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Arthritis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuous Infusion', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Ions', 'Isoleucine', 'Laboratories', 'Leucine', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Polysaccharides', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Price', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transistors', 'Trypsin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disulfide bond', 'electron energy', 'encryption', 'experience', 'fragment X', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'operation', 'preservation', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'signal processing', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker']",NIGMS,"E-MSION, INC.",R43,2020,212830,959155,0.021617794886882237

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9995511,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,302789,232986943,0.10296807011879058
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,58504236,0.06665086025691666
"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability.

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets. This new data approach has considerable impact for future generation methods in computational biophysics and drug design.",Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts,9989158,R01GM126189,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Future Generations', 'Geometry', 'Handwriting', 'Image Analysis', 'Induced Mutation', 'Ions', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Site', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thermodynamics', 'Work', 'algebraic topology', 'base', 'cofactor', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'diverse data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'models and simulation', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'search engine', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,318777,89938253,0.08610128888708006
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9963288,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384165,91477866,0.15727778071370682
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,329565273,0.10006267616715497
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,176988430,0.07483692330437927
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,9932039,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,431776,641965656,0.16504242319296505
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9894822,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'statistical learning', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,473065,533302350,0.10134154883272303
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9926115,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,491993,77336088,0.09657917111077312
"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9994932,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2020,495160,495160,0.14255347311540348
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9872026,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,563248,91477866,0.13247862469046867
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,377931988,0.04310485858242638
"High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes Project Summary All folded proteins continuously fluctuate between their low-energy native structures and higher-energy “hidden” conformations that can be partially or fully unfolded. Although each protein molecule passes through its high- energy conformations only a small fraction of the time, these states have major physiological consequences. Partially-folded states of natural proteins can lead to protein aggregation, organ failure, and death. Partially- folded states of therapeutic proteins can induce dangerous anti-drug antibodies. The energetic balance between the native, folded state and these diverse higher-energy states – in other words, the overall “energy landscape” – is thus critically important in protein aggregation and immunogenicity, as well as in allostery, signaling, off- target drug interactions and numerous other phenomena. Despite decades of research into energy landscapes our overall understanding is very limited: few proteins have been characterized in depth, accurate computational predictions are very challenging, and experimental measurements are expensive, slow, and labor-intensive. We propose a transformational approach to understand protein energy landscapes by integrating a new massively parallel experimental method, machine learning, and protein design. First, we are developing a new high-throughput assay using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to measure energy landscapes for thousands of proteins in parallel. This method finally brings the study of protein energy landscapes into the “omics” age. Critically, these experiments reveal both the overall folding stability and the energies of conformational fluctuations in each protein. For a subset of proteins (tens to hundreds), these parallel experiments reveal the specific sites of conformational fluctuations as well. Using this approach, we will measure the energy landscapes of thousands of natural proteins and tens of thousands of computationally designed proteins custom-built to systematically probe how specific properties affect energy landscapes. We will then train machine learning models to predict energy landscapes from sequence and structure, as well as optimize physical force fields to accurately model high-energy protein states. We will also catalyze advances in modeling throughout the community by organizing large-scale competitions at blind prediction of energy landscapes. Finally, with these new predictive models in hand, we will pursue a unique application: the development of energetically-optimized screening libraries for therapeutic protein and biological probe discovery. This overcomes a major challenge in drug and probe development. In sum, this study provides the experimental and computational tools to bring hidden protein states to light quantitatively on a massive scale. This fundamentally shifts our perspective: instead of examining energy landscapes only when they cause problems, we can make energy landscape analysis a central tool in biology and bioengineering. Project Narrative All proteins continuously move between their folded state and “hidden” higher-energy states that can be partially or fully unfolded. These hidden states have an important impact on how proteins interact, how they become activated, and whether they aggregate. Here, we combine protein design with a totally new high-throughput experimental approach to reveal these high-energy states for thousands of proteins in parallel, and apply these advances to build a new generation of computational models of protein energetics.",High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes,10002881,DP2GM140927,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Generations', 'Hand', 'Hydrogen', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organ failure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Training', 'blind', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenicity', 'predictive modeling', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,DP2,2020,2347906,367414121,0.14831523935938948
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Proteomics of ciliopathy protein complexes Summary Ciliopathies are a diverse class of developmental diseases that can manifest as defects in kidney, skeletal, eye, heart, reproductive, or mental function. Many ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, and Meckel Gruber Syndromes, are caused by defects in the major protein complexes that characterize the ciliary compartment. At least 1,000 proteins are associated with cilia biogenesis and function; uncovering the principles of ciliary protein organization thus requires a large scale, systematic investigation. Our current human protein complex maps, while extensive, have only moderate coverage of ciliary proteins, warranting the collection of targeted experimental datasets. I will use comparative proteomic analysis of cilia from multiple organisms to determine deeply conserved protein-protein interactions likely to be critical to ciliary function in humans. Examining human biological systems in the context of their level of conservation across species is a productive route to distinguish biological signal from noise. My preliminary data on three ciliated species confirm that this approach is capable of identifying conserved ciliary protein complexes. If a pair of proteins are found in physical contact in diverse species, having survived speciation events and gene loss, it can be predicted that this physical interaction is important. First, using mass spectrometry, we will experimentally detect protein complexes within the cilia across a spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, broadly defining conserved ciliary proteins. Second, we will integrate our own experimental data, some of which we have already collected, with outside data to construct a system-wide map of conserved ciliary protein complexes. These conserved ciliary protein complexes are strongly predicted to be functionally important in humans, and potentially involved in human birth defects. Finally, we will test a targeted subset of proteins predicted to associate with known birth defect proteins in vivo using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have four candidate genes in hand, and will consider candidates from the prior aims as appropriate. This project will lead to a map of critical conserved ciliary protein complexes, a future primary resource for research into diverse ciliopathies. Project Narrative!

"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9794010,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,304670088,0.06249178811950948
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9695242,K99HG009920,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enhancers', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plasmids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biochemical model', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized medicine', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'skills', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,90935,191864802,0.03476564327670554
"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2019,225875,80786674,0.08272174498286482
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9988741,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,238632,91477866,0.13247862469046867
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,9740715,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,244161,6676095,0.1176386162959809
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9684634,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,297553,77336088,0.09657917111077312
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,58504236,0.06665086025691666
"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9731549,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,384166,91477866,0.15727778071370682
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9627995,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,393339,329565273,0.10006267616715497
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level Project abstract Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein‐ protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process. In this research plan we implement a combination of chemical biology tools and approaches to define key binding interactions and conformational changes that produce function in vitro and in cells.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9712954,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,459955,533302350,0.10134154883272303
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9629970,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,563248,91477866,0.13247862469046867
"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9847841,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2019,990318,495160,0.14255347311540348
"Systems-level functional proteomics analysis assemblies in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of tauopathy The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively map and identify the subnetworks of synaptic protein complexes that are central players in the synaptic dysfunction occurring with neurodegeneration. We will use the emerging power of quantitative network proteomics in the Emili laboratory to systematically characterize the major protein assemblies present at normal and diseased synapses on a proteome scale. This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation. Aim 3 will identify complexes that are critical drivers of synaptic function by disrupting prioritized assemblies using genetic and opticogenetic tools. This work will determine key regulators of synaptic function in health and disease, and will also produce expanded genetic tools and outstanding targets for future approaches using bio-engineered regulation.

"Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein– protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features’ relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic– gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic–gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop methods to improve low-resolution crystal structures of proteins to high-resolution sufficient (1) to resolve key mechanistic features of enzyme function and disease, and (2) to design or screen drug molecules. In addition to method development, we will pursue crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase in complex with relevant antibiotic drugs.",Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures,9644449,F31GM123616,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'DNA Gyrase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Free Energy', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solvents', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'functional gain', 'improved', 'insight', 'interfacial', 'macromolecule', 'method development', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research and development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,37308,807432003,0.12779893444620605
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9539482,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,304670088,0.06249178811950948
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies SUMMARY Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection).

"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9431485,K99HG009920,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enhancers', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plasmids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biochemical model', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'lupus-like', 'personalized medicine', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'skills', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,120204,191864802,0.03476564327670554
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9693353,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,137386,232986943,0.10296807011879058
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs. We have developed a prototype technique that leverages eRNAs to infer the activity of all TF in a cell simultaneously.",A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity,9596778,R01GM125871,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Platelet Disorders', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ESR1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Estradiol', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Waardenburg syndrome', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cooking', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2018,286702,492483,0.045413078949361425
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9486119,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,297553,77336088,0.09657917111077312
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9563289,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,303474,232986943,0.10296807011879058
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9504498,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'AIDS therapy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,336086,58406802,0.09668624365880353
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9520213,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384167,91477866,0.15727778071370682
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9421497,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'member', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,444578,533302350,0.10134154883272303
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9420242,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,577782,91477866,0.13247862469046867
"Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning Project Summary/Abstract Allostery is action at a distance in proteins. It is a property by which perturbation at one site of a protein causes an effect at a distant site of the protein. As nature's biological switches allosteric proteins regulate virtually every major process including catalysis, transcription, transport and signaling. Kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors are therapeutically important allosteric proteins that play a major role in human health. Disruption of allosteric communication caused by mutations in these proteins is strongly associated with many types of disease abnormalities including cancer. Since the discovery of allostery in the 1960s, the molecular mechanism by which perturbation at one end of a protein is allosterically transmitted to the other end remains a mystery. Understanding molecular “rules” governing allostery is a fundamental problem in protein biochemistry and biophysics. Such rules may provide a deep insight into how proteins work through interactions between residues. Current approaches to studying allostery, which are biophysical, structural or computational, have two limitations. First, they provide an incomplete picture. Allostery involves the interplay of protein dynamics, structural changes and their effects on function. Probing each independently, as most studies do, does not give a complete understanding. Structure alone cannot explain dynamics, dynamical movement does not imply functional role, and functional studies may not provide insight into the underlying molecular causes. Second, detailed mechanistic studies of individual allosteric proteins while invaluable, are tedious, and cannot be scaled up to investigate many types of allosteric proteins. As a result, unifying heuristic rules would be difficult to infer from such individual case studies. The goal of my research is to develop a generalized, scalable method integrating structure, function and dynamics to understand, quantify and predict molecular drivers of protein allostery. With allosteric transcription factors as a model system, we will determine residues important for allostery (`hotspots') and their connectivity (`pathway') by deep mutational scanning, a method for large-scale functional characterization. We establish a critical link between structure and function by computationally modeling each mutation with Rosetta. We use machine learning on this rich sequence-structure-function dataset to recognize common molecular features (van der Waals, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds etc.) of allosteric hotspot residues, to build a predictive molecular model of allostery. Thus, we integrate high-throughput functional studies, structure-based modeling and machine learning to understand molecular rules governing allostery. Any allosteric protein whose activity can be coupled to a high-throughput screen, of which there are many, is amenable to our approach. Over time as the number and diversity of allosteric protein datasets increases, we expect that the accuracy and generalizability of predictions will continuously improve. Our long-term objective is to be able to (a) predict functional impact of thousands of mutations in disease-associated allosteric proteins revealed by genome sequencing (b) discover novel allosteric sites that improve selectivity and efficacy of drugs. Project Narrative GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ion channels and kinases are allosteric proteins that alone account for 44% of all human protein drug targets. We propose to develop a broad experimental and computational platform to understand molecular mechanism of allostery. This study will pave the way to explaining how dysfunction in allosteric proteins manifests into disease, and developing `smart' (allosteric) drugs that restore normal function.",Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning,9562195,DP2GM132682,"['Allosteric Site', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Case Study', 'Catalysis', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'drug efficacy', 'genome sequencing', 'heuristics', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular modeling', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'scale up', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,DP2,2018,2146877,338121506,0.16552487529975476

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9356560,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,343120,58406802,0.09668624365880353
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9375803,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,379776,91477866,0.15727778071370682
"Data-driven analysis of protein structure, function, and regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are capable of performing a wide variety of complex molecular functions and play a central role in all biological processes.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,329565273,0.10006267616715497
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9384431,R01GM081871,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,422166,113554200,0.06579669492465766
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8972013,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,292404,558628098,0.1804600307371982
"Data-driven analysis of protein structure, function, and regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are capable of performing a wide variety of complex molecular functions and play a central role in all biological processes.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9156099,R01GM120364,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'data structure', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2016,372928,58406802,0.09668624365880353
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,9059049,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate marker', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2016,423583,19252132,0.06029996276232134
"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,8917490,0.009367283565282524
"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses.

Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies.

"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""  Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation. that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles include transport of transforming growth factor-¿, and secretion of nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1¿ and IL-18. Exosomes may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.  miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion. Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate 80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.  Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.  Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80¿C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7 unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.  Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis. Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q- PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects. Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE   miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS,8842726,R21NS088138,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anterior', 'Astrocytes', 'Atrophic', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysesthesias', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gulf War', 'HLA G antigen', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Integrins', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipid Binding', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prions', 'Production', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rabies virus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Stress Tests', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'exhaustion', 'hemodynamics', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'response', 'sedentary', 'tau Proteins', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'white matter']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,155500,50343425,0.057066154758052705
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8773597,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,291815,558628098,0.1804600307371982
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8847691,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2015,421696,19252132,0.06029996276232134

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8633467,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2014,316023,61050884,0.12156839464808872
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.            ",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8685758,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2014,419855,19252132,0.06029996276232134
"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies. The resulting computer simulated models will support major advancements in drug discovery for human health, animal health and related research.            ",Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering,8781169,R44GM100520,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nature', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Time', 'Work', 'Yang', 'antibody engineering', 'anticancer research', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'glycosylation', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'restraint', 'screening', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"DNASTAR, INC.",R44,2014,746428,2499981,0.07462067819308776

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8450066,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2013,304962,61050884,0.12156839464808872
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human health has benefited tremendously from the therapeutic application of monoclonal antibodies (mAb), treating painful and devastating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, among others. However, mAb development is a laborious and time consuming process. The health benefits gained from faster mAb development are clear, creating a great need for tools to guide scientists toward discovering the most promising antigenic targets-particularly with regard to B-cell epitopes (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody). The critical barrier to progress in this domain is the inability to deduce the conformational characteristics of protein sequence in the absence of known structure for predicting linear B-cell epitopes-the largest, most diverse, and pharmaceutically valuable class of known epitopes. The general criticism of existing prediction methods is that they are inaccurate and do not address the conformational nature of B-cell epitopes.  DNASTAR proposes to create a software pipeline that guides the prediction of B-cell epitopes, models the dynamic structural interface between a monoclonal antibody and its experimentally identified antigen, and screens in silico site-directed mutations to engineer more potent antibodies with enhanced binding affinity. The Phase I goal is to improve the prediction of antigenic peptides from target protein sequences and experimental or predicted structures. Toward this goal, DNASTAR has established collaborations with experts in monoclonal antibody production, 3D structure prediction, and protein structure and dynamics, including access to their experimental methods, data, and software tools. Our predictive models will benefit from three key innovations: 1) a superior data set and professional insights into monoclonal antibody production, 2) the introduction of state of the art 3D structure prediction for training our epitope predictors, and 3) the first use of structure-based protein dynamics in B-cell epitope prediction.  At the conclusion of Phase I, we will deliver an enhanced sequence-only B-cell epitope prediction model when compared to current top prediction methods (Aim 1) and a superior sequence and structure-based epitope prediction model using 3D structure prediction and protein dynamics (Aim 2). In creating these models, we will account for the chemical and physical properties of a protein sequence and the biophysics that mediate protein-protein interactions, including solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding, residue flexibility, binding nuclei, and geometric contours of the molecular surface. The proposed software pipeline will be built upon Protean 3D, our new molecular structure and simulation viewer, and will elevate the technical capability of a broad range of experimental scientists to estimate key antigenic structural properties from proteins without known structure-all on their desktop computer. Upon achieving these aims, scientists will recognize that it is no longer adequate to describe B-cell epitopes using amino acid frequencies or propensity scales alone.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Monoclonal antibodies are invaluable tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases. Unfortunately, the experimental methods used today to identify the most promising immunogenic targets are time consuming and less than totally effective. By taking the novel approach of incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from high quality 3D structure predictions within our desktop computer software product, we propose to advance the ability of a broad range of life scientists to properly predict B-cell epitopes (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody) applicable to their area of interest. This will accelerate the discovery of new monoclonal antibody pharmaceuticals, leading to improved human health across many diseases.           Monoclonal antibodies are invaluable tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease. This proposal describes a new technology for advancing the measurement, prediction and design of protein complexes.",Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions,8328742,R01GM096466,"['Affinity', 'Apoptotic', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Calcium Binding', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EF Hand Motifs', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathology', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'SH3 Domains', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'globular protein', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insight', 'member', 'molecular recognition', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'small molecule', 'technology development']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,395872,113554200,0.2090711646602567
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest.

It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7753228,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2010,98700,7249069,0.10751876838058705
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7825413,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2010,273781,10239584,0.1483367777916525
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed drug lead optimization and computational screening exercises.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7842572,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2010,327180,61807989,0.11952415545395795
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7896417,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2010,332561,10159852,0.050266874196118555
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements.

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7983414,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2009,215112,10239584,0.1483367777916525
"Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is focused both on career development and on the completion of a specific independent research plan related particularly to the mission of the National Cancer Institute. The career development objective of this award is to enable the transition of Dr. Nathan Price from his current position as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Systems Biology to an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign capable of competing for independent funding in cancer research. Dr. Price has an exceptionally strong track record in systems biology for his career stage, having co-authored over 20 articles for publication in his graduate studies as well as completing significant cancer-related studies during his postdoctoral training. Dr. Price accepted a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign prior to finishing graduate school, but chose to defer this position for 2-3 years for the express purpose of transitioning his career focus onto systems analysis of cancer. The mentored phase of this award will provide Dr. Price with the opportunity to receive guidance from one of the leading scientists in the world working on systems approaches to cancer, Dr. Leroy Hood, who is President of the Institute for Systems Biology, Director of the Center for Systems Biology, and Co-Director of the Nanosystems Biology Cancer Center. Dr. Price's proposed research focuses on developing a novel capability to identify causal network perturbations involved in glioblastoma through analysis of patterns in secreted protein concentrations. This work will also focus on studying the relationship between transcriptomic data (which is plentiful) with secreted protein data (which serve as ideal diagnostic markers). The associated measurements of secreted proteins will provide a wealth of candidate markers for glioblastomas, and a team of glioblastoma researchers has been assembled to assist in translating the work of this project to the clinic (to be financed elsewhere). The ultimate long-term goal of this work is to develop highly informative secreted protein marker panels for glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and deadly form of glioma. The use of systems analysis of blood, coupled with computational models of interacting networks such as will be developed in this-study, has the long-term potential not only of identifying perturbed networks in vivo, but eventually of enabling a new avenue of studying human biology and disease in vivo in a non-invasive manner.      The relevance of this work to public health is that specific secreted protein markers for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer common particularly in children, will be developed where none exist today. These rnarkers will allow for the earlier diagnosis and hence better prognosis of patients, and will be far less irjvasive than the brain biopsy currently required to diagnose advanced gliomas. Also, we will identify perturbed subnetworks in the most aggressive type of glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) leading to potential drug targets for further analysis.                    n/a",Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma,7917085,R00CA126184,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Arts', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Australia', 'Award', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Buffers', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caseins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Core Facility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dissociation', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Film', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glean', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Halobacterium', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humidity', 'IGFBP2 gene', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunization', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incubated', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organ Specificity', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Personal Communication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Fingerprints', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Refractive Indices', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Serum-Free Culture Media', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'analog', 'base', 'biological systems', 'candidate marker', 'cell growth', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'clinical application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'cytokine', 'dalton', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaust', 'follow-up', 'glioma cell line', 'halobacteria', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'knowledge base', 'light intensity', 'macrophage', 'mass spectrometer', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'nanosystems', 'network models', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oligodendroglioma', 'polyclonal antibody', 'preference', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R00,2009,249000,76545728,0.018539474577764378
"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7625220,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,330166,558628098,0.11952415545395795
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7646234,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2009,335920,10159852,0.050266874196118555
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7676045,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2009,494433,31980265,0.10115390156755044

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16).

"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence- based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7473118,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2008,335920,10159852,0.050266874196118555
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7622959,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'software development', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2008,536748,31980265,0.10115390156755044
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7286095,K22LM008794,"['Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Antibodies', 'Antigenic Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Buffers', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissociation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Haptens', 'Hemolysin', 'Immunology', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'antibody engineering', 'antigen antibody binding', 'antigen binding', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental analysis', 'markov model', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanopore', 'programs', 'protein structure function', 'prototype', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'tool', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2007,162000,157330,0.06808600555638947
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)).

Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7317856,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2007,335920,10159852,0.050266874196118555
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells. Experience gained in the course of these studies will be used to direct and refine hardware and software development.           n/a",FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY,7163551,R01GM060678,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Centromere', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Chromosomes', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Kinetochores', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubule Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Plus End of the Microtubule', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tubulin', 'Writing', 'Xenopus', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'charge coupled device camera', 'depolymerization', 'egg', 'experience', 'fluorophore', 'in vitro Assay', 'interest', 'numb protein', 'polymerization', 'programs', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'software development', 'tissue/cell culture']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2007,475153,511185245,0.048852324136919874
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7119996,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2006,162000,157330,0.06808600555638947
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses.

"Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lupus nephritis (LN) affects up to 65% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and results in renal failure in up to 42% of patients after five years. Renal failure rates can vary up to eight fold over five years in aggressive LN despite use of the same treatment protocol. A more reliable means of determining prognosis is therefore required. The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify noninvasive urine protein markers of disease that are predictive of renal compromise. Previous studies in this area have resulted in the identification of a limited number of candidate proteins that correlate with disease type and glomerular inflammatory activity. To develop models of prognostic indicators in a heterogeneous disorder such as LN, the candidate protein approach has limited power. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to determine: 1) differentially expressed proteins in the urine of LN subjects (revealed by proteomic techniques and artificial neural network (ANN) technology) as surrogate markers of the WHO class, activity, and chronicity of glomerular lesions on renal biopsy and 2) the feasibility of a larger study designed to examine these urine protein markers as predictors of renal outcome in LN. To address these aims, urine from 1) LN subjects undergoing renal biopsy and 2) subjects with either LN or SLE without LN will be analyzed using proteomic techniques. All subjects will be followed prospectively for renal outcomes. Urine proteins will be concentrated and resolved by 2D-gel electrophoresis. Spots will be identified by location and removed for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting. Data from these procedures will be analyzed using ANN modeling to determine surrogate urine protein markers of WHO class, activity, and chronicity of LN renal biopsies. ANN will be used to determine surrogate markers that predict compromise in renal function due to LN. These markers will be compared to renal biopsy and traditional laboratory and clinical indices of disease as predictors of renal outcome. Within the two years of this study, surrogate urine protein markers of biopsy findings should be identified, and the feasibility of a long-term outcome study should be determined. The ultimate results of this study could revolutionize the manner in which treatment for LN is determined. Due to the power of proteomic and ANN techniques, novel mediators of disease activity and damage should be identified and thus contribute to the development of more targeted therapies for LN. n/a",Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis,6951552,R21AR051719,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'kidney disorder diagnosis', 'lupus nephritis', 'mass spectrometry', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'prognosis', 'protein purification', 'proteomics', 'two dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'urinalysis']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2005,63000,136810522,0.075200800811962

"Aptamer Development for Cancer Diagnosis and Management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early diagnosis of disease allows for more effective therapy and better clinical outcomes.  In cancer, extensive effort has gone toward development of screening and diagnostic techniques for early detection of disease. Despite this effort, the probability of single-analyte assays providing the ""silver bullet"" to address these problems for any specific tumor is vanishingly small. A more comprehensive approach that is more likely to succeed is the development of an integrated molecular diagnostic system using multiplexed assays of cancer-related biomarkers coupled with data analysis using bioinformatics-based algorithms. The development of multiplexed assays to improve quality of patient life is a major goal of SomaLogic. SomaLogic's proprietary nucleic-acid based capture agents, photoaptamers, yield quantitative analysis of proteins found in complex biological samples. Using data generated with this assay platform, we expect to develop predictive biomedical algorithms for the diagnosis and management of a variety of diseases, including cancer.   The specific objective of this Phase I proposal is to develop an initial set of photoaptamers targeted to proteins and/or protein complexes that have been associated with a wide variety of solid tumors, i.e., proteinases, proteinase inhibitors, and proteinase-inhibitor complexes, which can then be used to screen clinical samples from patients with a variety of solid tumor types and stages of disease. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop a set of well-defined photoaptamers specific for 20 proteinases, antiproteinases and proteinase-antiproteinase complexes that are believed to be associated with invasion and metastasis of solid tumors; 2) develop a photoaptamer microarray assay (""proteomics chip"") for the measurement of at least 20 cognate proteins or protein complexes in serum or plasma; and 3) evaluate the ranges for these proteins or protein complexes in serum and plasma obtained from normal subjects.   The overall objective of our research efforts in cancer is to develop CLIA-compatible assays and algorithm-based analysis systems for the monitoring of patients at risk for or diagnosed with various malignancies using aptamers directed against proteins that are either generally associated (proteinases, antiproteinases, adhesion molecules chemokines and/or chemokine receptors) or specifically associated (known cell markers, tissue specific proteins, transcriptional regulators, etc.) with solid tumors. n/a",Aptamer Development for Cancer Diagnosis and Management,6785751,R43CA108005,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'chemical binding', 'chemical synthesis', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'early diagnosis', 'endopeptidases', 'enzyme complex', 'enzyme inhibitors', 'mathematics', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'oligonucleotides', 'proteomics', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,"SOMALOGIC, INC.",R43,2004,99853,0,0.011563174575296611
"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,0,0.032563438276780314
