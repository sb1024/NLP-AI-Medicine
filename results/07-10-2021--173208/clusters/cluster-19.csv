"Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Project Summary/Abstract Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are low-income and never/underscreened (never screened or under screened) especially in Indiana, where cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher than the US national average, and screening is lower than the US national average. Women who are low- income have structural and intrapersonal barriers to screening that may prevent them from obtaining provider- based screening. Although HPV testing is now accepted by USPTF guidelines, it is only endorsed for provider- collected sampling. Self-sampling for HPV testing, a method for women to collect their own cervico-vaginal sample, has been established as a feasible and acceptable alternative to provider-based cervical cancer screening in other countries and is supported by US pilot studies. HPV self-sampling is likely to be implemented as a screening option in the US in the future due to its comparable sensitivity to provider- collected HPV samples, acceptability, and potential to reach populations who are never/underscreeners. Self- sampling may overcome barriers to provider-based cervical cancer screening experienced by women who are low-income and never/underscreened and provide a convenient way to access screening. Studies testing mailed HPV kits, however, have demonstrated that 30-50% of women do not return a mailed HPV kit. Prior to widespread implementation, research is needed to identify characteristics of returners and non-returners of mailed HPV self-sampling kits. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify factors associated with mailed return of HPV self-sampling kits using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self-efficacy) while controlling for sociodemographic, healthcare, and health behavior variables in a group of low-income and never/underscreened women. Data for this cross-sectional study will be collected at time of study consent from women (n=200) at a food pantry and nonadherent to cervical cancer screening using valid and reliable instruments. Self-sampling kits will be mailed to the women’s home within one week of consent, and women will have 4 weeks to return the kit to be considered “returners”. Logistic regression analyses will be used to analyze the relationship between the data collected at baseline consent (attributes of innovation-advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self- efficacy) and return of the self-sampling kit via mail (y/n). The results of this study will provide knowledge about factors associated with return of self-sampling kits to better understand the characteristics of returners and non-returners. Results of this project will help guide implementation of HPV self-sampling in populations who are low-income and never/underscreened whom self- sampling may most likely benefit. This study will provide a foundation for the applicant’s long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer through increasing cervical cancer screening rates with an innovative technology, self-sampling for HPV testing. Project Narrative Women who are low-income and never/underscreeners are unequally burdened by cervical cancer. This study will be one of the first to identify factors associated with mailed return of a cervical cancer screening tool, self- sampling for HPV self-testing, that will provide an alternative to traditional cervical screening by removing barriers for women most at risk for cervical cancer (women who are low-income and never/underscreeners).",Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing,10025580,F31NR018791,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appointment', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Netherlands', 'Nurses', 'Pain', 'Pap smear', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time Study', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cost effective', 'experience', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2020,32590,232986943,-0.02092963007535988
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'social factors', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,33937,241268189,-0.003791028728947944
"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy,9991192,F31HD100171,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Navier–Stokes equations', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Paris, France', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placentation', 'Play', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Uteroplacental Circulation', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Vascular System', 'Velocimetries', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'arterial remodeling', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'fetal', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal risk', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'phantom model', 'predictive marker', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pressure', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,593605914,-0.056023243655533385
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9999677,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,304670088,0.011767090398226524
"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Censuses', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Set', 'Dermatology', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research Subjects', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'base', 'disease classification', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population stratification', 'racial bias', 'recruit']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,560644462,0.009334269095664366
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk.

"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,551214295,0.02114777391240115

This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",9892855,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2020,124188,228951281,-0.04428448555787873
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,146629556,-0.010636551602167008
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,232986943,0.010058233485895877
"Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention PROJECT ABSTRACT  In the U.S., from 2011 to 2014, 7,208 maternal fatalities, with the trend worsening year-on-year (CDC, 2016). In addition to the 700+ fatalities, at least 50,000 woman experienced life-threatening complications, annually. According to CDC (2019) for every fatality, 70 more women suffer avoidable, traumatic complications as a result of pregnancy.  Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc, propose the evaluation of a cardiac risk assessment tool for pregnant and postpartum women; this tool updates automatically directly from patient medical records; wearable devices; and patient surveys. Success implies disruptive improvement in women's health. Proposed research involves three key elements: technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDOH) using geospatial mapping of patient locations. Technology: Study technology shall be based on the Invaryant Health Platform (IHP), a technology that automatically ingests data, from medical records, wearable devices, and other sources using proprietary AI based interoperability technology called Mesh-Complex Method Exchange (Mesh-CMX). We propose using the IHP in conjunction with novel prototype-level technology, namely Healthy Outcomes for all Pregnancy Experiences-Cardiovascular-risk Assessment Technology (HOPE-CAT) and the Invaryant machine learning technologies to monitor the patient, based on signals, out-of-range “trip-wires”, and trends in the mother's health data that merit medical intervention. By extending the proof of concept into an early commercial version of the software, and integrating it to the IHP which will automatically update changes in the patient's medical record, we will provide an “early warning” system for mothers and their providers. Data: The study will be tested on patients' medical records using the MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 Million unique patients. The tool will subsequently have the potential to be leveraged to over 90 million medical records for the MedStar and Cerner hospital systems, distilled down to meet specific eligibility criteria including, gender, age, race, pregnancy and medical outcomes. A second phase of this project would take the findings from the retrospective study (this grant request) and use the technology within the Medstar hospital system, to validate the efficacy of the findings in a “real-world setting”. Using our proprietary AI technology, we will compare each mother's progress against a cohort of retrospective data to enhance diagnostics and provide real-time feedback to caregivers and patients. Geospatial mapping: Mapping the patient medical record and the health information to their social setting is vital for understanding the underlying social constructs that affect the health of mothers in different regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc. propose the evaluation of a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (HOPE-CAT) for pregnant and postpartum women utilizing technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDoH) with geospatial mapping. HOPE- CAT, in conjunction with Invaryant's health platform and machine learning technologies, will monitor the patient based on signals, out-of-range ""trip-wires"", and trends in health data. HOPE-CAT will be validated on patient medical records using MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 million unique patients.","Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention",10200448,UL1TR001409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eclampsia', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Experience', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Population', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'data ingestion', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health data', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'personalized intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'venous thromboembolism', 'wearable device']",NCATS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,146537,50343425,0.002253373845089133
"Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 80% of older adults with cancer. It is associated with the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), which have risk greater than benefit in older adults. In older adults with cancer, PP/PIMs have been associated in some studies with adverse outcomes, including poor adherence to and tolerance of cancer therapy and decrease in physical functioning. However, these data have been inconsistent, and studies to date have examined specific populations (such as disease-specific subgroups enrolled in clinical trials) that may not be representative of the general population of older adults with cancer. This proposal presents a 2-year research and career development plan focused on examining a cohort (n=370) of older adults with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy in community oncology clinics. This is a secondary analysis of the control arm of the Geriatric Assessment Intervention for Patients Aged 70 and Over Receiving Chemotherapy or Similar Agents for Advanced Cancer (“GAP”): Reducing Toxicity in Older Adults study (URCC 13059, principal investigator is primary mentor Dr. Mohile), describing prevalence and patterns of PP/PIMs as well as the relationship of PP/PIMs to adverse outcomes including relative dose intensity of chemotherapy (RDI, a ratio of received to standard doses of chemotherapy), chemotherapy toxicity, and functional trajectory. The candidate, Dr. Erika Ramsdale, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and is board-certified in both Oncology and Geriatric Medicine. This proposal builds upon her prior systematic review of PP/PIMs in older patients with cancer, showing the limited data available in the literature, and her work demonstrating that PP/PIMs are associated with functional impairments in older adults with advanced cancer prior to initiating chemotherapy. The aims of the proposed study are: 1/to test the hypotheses that PP/PIMs rates will be higher than reported in most prior studies, and over-the-counter medications will comprise the majority of PIMs detected; 2/to examine the association of PP/PIMs and the following adverse outcomes in older adults with cancer starting chemotherapy: chemotherapy tolerability at 3 months (RDI, grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity), and functional decline over 3 months. An exploratory aim will also compare the performance of regression and other supervised classification methods to model and predict factors influencing chemotherapy toxicity, including PP/PIMs and functional status. The proposal describes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to develop complementary skills and knowledge in in polypharmacy, quantitative analysis, and data science. Under the guidance of her primary mentor Dr. Supriya Mohile, co-mentors Dr. Holly Holmes and Dr. Martin Zand, and advisor Dr. Eva Culakova, she will advance her skills in these areas with the long-term goal of becoming an independent geriatric oncology researcher implementing and testing multi-level interventions to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polypharmacy, or taking multiple concurrent medications, is very common in older adults with cancer receiving cancer treatment, and increases the risk of taking one or more medications which are “potentially inappropriate” based on having higher risk than benefit in older adults. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications may be associated with adverse outcomes such as chemotherapy toxicity and functional decline in older adults with cancer. This proposal will examine the prevalence of polypharmacy, patterns of medication use, and impact of polypharmacy on tolerability of cancer treatment and functional trajectory in older patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy.","Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy",10027448,R03AG067977,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Antihistamines', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Companions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Holly', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'impaired functional status', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'interest', 'older patient', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'systematic review']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R03,2020,154000,179705973,-0.01383796719033082
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,338121506,0.020073046692595985
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,673201228,-0.018125925195055025
"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10040416,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,175248,593605914,0.0365015544646547
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,10018932,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal maturation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preterm newborn', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,193125,230060143,0.008720567154315882
"CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement Abstract  This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-20-032. This is a supplement to U54 CA242646, “California-Mexico-Puerto Rico Partnership (CAMPO) Center for Prevention of HPV-related Cancer in HIV+ Populations”. The parent grant's focus is to perform research on reducing the risk of cervical and anal cancer in men and women living with HIV in Latin America. CAMPO Study 1 will enroll 4000 women and 1000 men living with HIV to optimize screening algorithms to detect cervical and anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The incidence of anal cancer is high among all groups of Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among those in Puerto Rico (PR). HPV infection is necessary but insufficient for the development of anal HSIL and cancer. The goal of this supplement is to elucidate the role of the anal microbiome as a contributor to this increased risk of anal cancer risk in these high-risk populations. Specific aims are 1) Study the relationship between anal high- risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and PR; and 2) Study the relationship between anal HSIL and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV infection. These populations are of particular interest given their divergent lifestyles but similarity in genetic background. We hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH without anal HSIL, the microbiome will be different among those with and without hr-HPV infection. We hypothesize that the proportion with pro-inflammatory-mediating taxa will be highest among the PR population compared with the Mexican and California populations given the higher incidence in anal cancer in PR. We also hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV at the 3 locations, detection of HSIL will be associated with a pro-inflammatory microbiome and a decrease in butyrate-producing signatures, with the proportion with pro-inflammatory changes highest in PR compared with the other populations.  We will enroll 100 PLWH (50 men and 50 women) at each of the PR, Mexico City and San Francisco CAMPO sites, for a total of 300 Hispanic PLWH. Data on anal HPV, anal cytology and anal HSIL will be available through CAMPO Study 1 in PR and Mexico City, and from the San Francisco ANCRE Clinic, where PLWH are screened for anal HSIL as part of routine clinical care. A validated food frequency questionnaire in Spanish will be administered to assess dietary intake for the previous 3 and 6 months. Anal swab specimens will be retrieved from the CAMPO Biorepository and used for microbiome analysis. The 16S gene will be amplified from extracted anal swab genomic DNA and subjected to Illumina Miseq. Sequences of the 16S gene V4 region will be analyzed in QIIME2. Random forest classification will be performed to understand how our predictors, i.e. microbiome variables (diversity measurements, species-level taxa) and other covariates (sociodemographics, sex, diet, clinical data, etc.), are associated with hr-HPV infection or HSIL (outcomes). Narrative As the incidence of anal cancer is high in Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially in Puerto Rico, this supplement aims to study the relationship between anal high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and Puerto Rico (PR). Building on the parent U54 California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium infrastructure, we will enroll 300 Hispanic PLWH from the study sites, collect anal swabs for anal HPV testing, cytology and microbiome analysis, perform high resolution anoscopy and collect data to assess dietary intake. The anal microbiota profiles will be analyzed among the three Hispanic populations and will shed light on the role of the anal microbiome in potentiating anal HPV-related anal disease in these high- risk populations.",CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement,10166395,U54CA242646,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Biopsy', 'Butyrates', 'California', 'Cervical', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Latin America', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncoproteins', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Puerto Rico', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'Swab', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'biobank', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cervical and anal cancer', 'clinical care', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'interest', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'microbiota profiles', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'therapeutic vaccine']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2020,194934,685608202,-0.08384098495310176
"Identifying Protective and Risk Factors for Non-infectious Uveitis Project Summary/Abstract Background Information and Relevance: Uveitis is an important cause of permanent vision loss that affects younger patients. Despite the human and economic impact of this disease, the risk factors for non-infectious uveitis are poorly understood. This is in part because epidemiologic studies of uveitis have been limited by insufficient numbers of participants. Newly available large health care claims databases provide an opportunity to increase the ability to detect uveitis risk factors. Hypotheses: Metformin, statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with a lower incidence of non-infectious uveitis, while female hormonal therapies are associated with a higher incidence of non-infectious uveitis. Specific Objectives: 1. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation to putative protective medications, including metformin, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. 2. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation the modifiable risk factor of female hormonal therapy, including hormonal replacement therapy and hormonal contraceptive therapy. Methods: The Clinformatics™ Data Mart Database contains medical claims on over 60 million beneficiaries from a large insurer in the United States. We will define non-infectious uveitis based on validated diagnosis codes recorded by an eye care provider twice within a 120-day period and exclusion of infectious or surgical causes of uveitis with diagnosis and procedural codes. Potential confounders including demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, financial net worth) and clinical (smoking exposure) covariate information will be extracted from the database. Medication exposure will be rigorously captured based on the filling of outpatient prescriptions or coding of clinic-administered therapies. The cohort not exposed to the medication will be matched on age (±3 years), race/ethnicity, sex and date of plan entry and exit (±3 months) to the medication-exposed cohort. Propensity scores for each medication exposure will be estimated using multivariable logistic regression and the rich information on comorbid conditions and treatments available in the database. With multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we will calculate the hazard ratios for incident non-infectious uveitis based on exposure to each of the medications listed above. To account for the possibility of systematic differences between individuals with and without the exposures of interest, the Cox proportional hazards models will be weighted by the inverse of the predicted probability of their observed exposures using the propensity scores. We will interpret the results taking into the account the multiple comparisons being tested. Implications: The well-powered, rigorous analyses proposed here offer a unique opportunity to identify novel modifiable protective and risk factors for non-infectious uveitis, guide practice patterns for discontinuation of medications that increase uveitis risk, and inform the development of clinical trials for medications for secondary uveitis prevention. Project Narrative Uveitis is an eye disease that causes blindness disproportionately in young and working-age Americans, and we do not completely understand the risk factors for developing uveitis. Our study aims to uncover the risk factors for uveitis, including whether some medications may play a role in uveitis risk.

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,9892136,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,233832,570146095,0.0007318067263397755
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” approach to the treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.",Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer,9946702,R21AG066980,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Digital Photography', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Solid', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Markers', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'computer science', 'end of life', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mobile application', 'neglect', 'older patient', 'overtreatment', 'personalized care', 'randomized trial', 'standard of care', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'tumor', 'usability']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,236550,560644462,0.013959619115759454
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,327644200,0.0065791877210001105
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents.

"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10050234,R61AG068945,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care disparity', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'multi-site trial', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'peer', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,315340,593605914,0.010707800245245036
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,533594881,0.009531898265029388
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9879630,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,454065,641965656,0.03338595426739681
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. Analyses will examine overall effect of buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicide attempt or death, heterogeneity of effects in patient subgroups, and specificity of effects to buprenorphine vs other medications.",Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior,10136935,U19MH121738,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Buprenorphine', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naltrexone', 'Observational Study', 'Overdose', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Suicide attempt', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Weight', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'World Health', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'chronic pain', 'data resource', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'health record', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'member', 'mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction model', 'severe mental illness', 'social factors', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U19,2020,514616,111231681,-0.07695742971700971
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,41751724,-0.011132927324783989
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9922214,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'social factors', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,522652,685608202,-0.007458900330268353
"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'caucasian American', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'health administration', 'health difference', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'racial difference', 'racial health disparity', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,179705973,0.012959192743141806
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,641965656,-0.04079202706459236
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,415711940,-0.050090476590681214
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",10021656,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'postpartum outcome', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,662614,111231681,0.005035412753686822
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality. The study is very likely to have a high impact on identifying key environmental factors that can prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 progression.",The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality,10152911,R01ES029963,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Asthma', 'Body mass index', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coronavirus', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'ambient air pollution', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'coarse particles', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'fine particles', 'high risk', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'traffic-related air pollution']",NIEHS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,670296,111231681,-0.02308195501382248
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,89938253,0.0023129114722820047
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10051711,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,707286,26672071,0.021588140249475064
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care.

"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare,9988785,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk stratification', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,1216161,327644200,-0.007490047694615479
"Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women Project Abstract Uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] due to poor blood pressure [BP] medication adherence in young and early middle age African American [AA] women is a leading contributor for the sustained hypertension disparities in the US. AA women in the US 20-44 years of age, have the highest prevalence of Hypertension [HTN] when compared to White women of the same age group. Uncontrolled HTN is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, and early mortality, especially in this at-risk group. Barriers prohibiting BP medication adherence have been well characterized across the AA population except in young AA women who bear an unequal and different burden of stressors than older AA women. However, important underlying factors including HTN illness perceptions/representations, unique psychosocial factors including resilient coping, and their influence on good BP medication adherence have not been sufficiently studied among this vulnerable group. Evidence indicating that AAs acquire HTN at younger ages, are less adherent, and are more resistant to treatment compared to other ethnic groups provides a compelling impetus to identify positive and modifiable factors that contribute to BP medication adherence. The specific aims of this cross-sectional dissertation study are to examine the relationships among sociodemographic & clinical profiles, HTN illness perceptions, and BP medication adherence; and examine the relationships between psychosocial factors, resilient coping style, and BP medication adherence when controlling for sociodemographic factors in a sample of young hypertensive AA women. An exploratory aim will examine the relationship of resilient coping as a potential moderator of high or low adverse stress exposure and its effect on BP medication adherence to elicit understanding of variability in BP medication adherence among this subgroup of hypertensive women. A total of 110 AA women diagnosed with HTN, 18-45 years of age, will be recruited through an ongoing community health heart screening project which is targeting AA women diagnosed with HTN, at-risk for HTN, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large southern urban setting. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression will be used for statistical analysis of the aims. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards understanding the impact of modifiable factors such as HTN illness perceptions and resilient coping, and their impact on BP medication adherence in this vulnerable population. This study will provide important data to inform development and testing of effective and targeted interventions to reduce HTN disparities while improving health outcomes in a population predisposed to adverse cardiovascular events. Project Narrative Young and early middle age adult AA women represent a growing group of ethnic minority women diagnosed with hypertension in the United States. This study will examine novel constructs (HTN illness Perceptions and Resilient Coping) and psychosocial factors in relation to hypertension medication adherence to determine their importance in facilitating medication adherence in a population for whom limited information is known regarding factors associated with increased levels of medication adherence. Information gained from this study may advance the field of cardiovascular research and ethnic minority hypertension disparities and may help develop culturally targeted interventions to reduce poor medication adherence, thus improving rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the future.",Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women,9677584,F31NR017348,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Community Health', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coping Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Discrimination', 'Single Parent', 'Social Class', 'Social support', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Support System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'age group', 'associated symptom', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'coping', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective intervention', 'enhancing factor', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'medication compliance', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'racial discrimination', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'success', 'theories', 'urban setting', 'young woman']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,14236,507546965,0.022771190891216615
"Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Project Summary/Abstract Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are low-income and never/underscreened (never screened or under screened) especially in Indiana, where cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher than the US national average, and screening is lower than the US national average. Women who are low- income have structural and intrapersonal barriers to screening that may prevent them from obtaining provider- based screening. Although HPV testing is now accepted by USPTF guidelines, it is only endorsed for provider- collected sampling. Self-sampling for HPV testing, a method for women to collect their own cervico-vaginal sample, has been established as a feasible and acceptable alternative to provider-based cervical cancer screening in other countries and is supported by US pilot studies. HPV self-sampling is likely to be implemented as a screening option in the US in the future due to its comparable sensitivity to provider- collected HPV samples, acceptability, and potential to reach populations who are never/underscreeners. Self- sampling may overcome barriers to provider-based cervical cancer screening experienced by women who are low-income and never/underscreened and provide a convenient way to access screening. Studies testing mailed HPV kits, however, have demonstrated that 30-50% of women do not return a mailed HPV kit. Prior to widespread implementation, research is needed to identify characteristics of returners and non-returners of mailed HPV self-sampling kits. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify factors associated with mailed return of HPV self-sampling kits using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self-efficacy) while controlling for sociodemographic, healthcare, and health behavior variables in a group of low-income and never/underscreened women. Data for this cross-sectional study will be collected at time of study consent from women (n=200) at a food pantry and nonadherent to cervical cancer screening using valid and reliable instruments. Self-sampling kits will be mailed to the women’s home within one week of consent, and women will have 4 weeks to return the kit to be considered “returners”. Logistic regression analyses will be used to analyze the relationship between the data collected at baseline consent (attributes of innovation-advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self- efficacy) and return of the self-sampling kit via mail (y/n). The results of this study will provide knowledge about factors associated with return of self-sampling kits to better understand the characteristics of returners and non-returners. Results of this project will help guide implementation of HPV self-sampling in populations who are low-income and never/underscreened whom self- sampling may most likely benefit. This study will provide a foundation for the applicant’s long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer through increasing cervical cancer screening rates with an innovative technology, self-sampling for HPV testing. Project Narrative Women who are low-income and never/underscreeners are unequally burdened by cervical cancer. This study will be one of the first to identify factors associated with mailed return of a cervical cancer screening tool, self- sampling for HPV self-testing, that will provide an alternative to traditional cervical screening by removing barriers for women most at risk for cervical cancer (women who are low-income and never/underscreeners).",Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing,9835517,F31NR018791,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appointment', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Netherlands', 'Nurses', 'Pain', 'Pap smear', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time Study', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cost effective', 'experience', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2019,32086,232986943,-0.02092963007535988
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33183,241268189,-0.003791028728947944
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9794014,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,304670088,0.011767090398226524
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations.

"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9767273,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2019,83193,148463823,0.034649269968050574
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,232986943,0.010058233485895877
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,338121506,0.020073046692595985
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,673201228,-0.018125925195055025
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,9872417,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231750,230060143,0.008720567154315882
"Identifying Protective and Risk Factors for Non-infectious Uveitis Project Summary/Abstract Background Information and Relevance: Uveitis is an important cause of permanent vision loss that affects younger patients. Despite the human and economic impact of this disease, the risk factors for non-infectious uveitis are poorly understood. This is in part because epidemiologic studies of uveitis have been limited by insufficient numbers of participants. Newly available large health care claims databases provide an opportunity to increase the ability to detect uveitis risk factors. Hypotheses: Metformin, statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with a lower incidence of non-infectious uveitis, while female hormonal therapies are associated with a higher incidence of non-infectious uveitis. Specific Objectives: 1. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation to putative protective medications, including metformin, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. 2. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation the modifiable risk factor of female hormonal therapy, including hormonal replacement therapy and hormonal contraceptive therapy. Methods: The Clinformatics™ Data Mart Database contains medical claims on over 60 million beneficiaries from a large insurer in the United States. We will define non-infectious uveitis based on validated diagnosis codes recorded by an eye care provider twice within a 120-day period and exclusion of infectious or surgical causes of uveitis with diagnosis and procedural codes. Potential confounders including demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, financial net worth) and clinical (smoking exposure) covariate information will be extracted from the database. Medication exposure will be rigorously captured based on the filling of outpatient prescriptions or coding of clinic-administered therapies. The cohort not exposed to the medication will be matched on age (±3 years), race/ethnicity, sex and date of plan entry and exit (±3 months) to the medication-exposed cohort. Propensity scores for each medication exposure will be estimated using multivariable logistic regression and the rich information on comorbid conditions and treatments available in the database. With multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we will calculate the hazard ratios for incident non-infectious uveitis based on exposure to each of the medications listed above. To account for the possibility of systematic differences between individuals with and without the exposures of interest, the Cox proportional hazards models will be weighted by the inverse of the predicted probability of their observed exposures using the propensity scores. We will interpret the results taking into the account the multiple comparisons being tested. Implications: The well-powered, rigorous analyses proposed here offer a unique opportunity to identify novel modifiable protective and risk factors for non-infectious uveitis, guide practice patterns for discontinuation of medications that increase uveitis risk, and inform the development of clinical trials for medications for secondary uveitis prevention.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9873378,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,368614,641965656,0.03338595426739681

"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9745267,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,567836,685608202,-0.007458900330268353
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,646285,415711940,-0.050090476590681214
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,276703803,-0.002141046983030501
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",9900630,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'polypeptide C', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,800511,111231681,0.005035412753686822
"Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women Project Abstract Uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] due to poor blood pressure [BP] medication adherence in young and early middle age African American [AA] women is a leading contributor for the sustained hypertension disparities in the US. AA women in the US 20-44 years of age, have the highest prevalence of Hypertension [HTN] when compared to White women of the same age group. Uncontrolled HTN is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, and early mortality, especially in this at-risk group. Barriers prohibiting BP medication adherence have been well characterized across the AA population except in young AA women who bear an unequal and different burden of stressors than older AA women. However, important underlying factors including HTN illness perceptions/representations, unique psychosocial factors including resilient coping, and their influence on good BP medication adherence have not been sufficiently studied among this vulnerable group. Evidence indicating that AAs acquire HTN at younger ages, are less adherent, and are more resistant to treatment compared to other ethnic groups provides a compelling impetus to identify positive and modifiable factors that contribute to BP medication adherence. The specific aims of this cross-sectional dissertation study are to examine the relationships among sociodemographic & clinical profiles, HTN illness perceptions, and BP medication adherence; and examine the relationships between psychosocial factors, resilient coping style, and BP medication adherence when controlling for sociodemographic factors in a sample of young hypertensive AA women. An exploratory aim will examine the relationship of resilient coping as a potential moderator of high or low adverse stress exposure and its effect on BP medication adherence to elicit understanding of variability in BP medication adherence among this subgroup of hypertensive women. A total of 110 AA women diagnosed with HTN, 18-45 years of age, will be recruited through an ongoing community health heart screening project which is targeting AA women diagnosed with HTN, at-risk for HTN, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large southern urban setting. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression will be used for statistical analysis of the aims. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards understanding the impact of modifiable factors such as HTN illness perceptions and resilient coping, and their impact on BP medication adherence in this vulnerable population. This study will provide important data to inform development and testing of effective and targeted interventions to reduce HTN disparities while improving health outcomes in a population predisposed to adverse cardiovascular events. Project Narrative Young and early middle age adult AA women represent a growing group of ethnic minority women diagnosed with hypertension in the United States. This study will examine novel constructs (HTN illness Perceptions and Resilient Coping) and psychosocial factors in relation to hypertension medication adherence to determine their importance in facilitating medication adherence in a population for whom limited information is known regarding factors associated with increased levels of medication adherence. Information gained from this study may advance the field of cardiovascular research and ethnic minority hypertension disparities and may help develop culturally targeted interventions to reduce poor medication adherence, thus improving rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the future.",Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women,9541705,F31NR017348,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Community Health', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coping Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Discrimination', 'Single Parent', 'Social Class', 'Social support', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Support System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'age group', 'associated symptom', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'coping', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective intervention', 'enhancing factor', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'medication compliance', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'racial discrimination', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'success', 'theories', 'urban setting', 'young woman']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,507546965,0.022771190891216615
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9485199,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58392,560644462,0.03757339574705171
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9436167,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2018,72343,324592664,0.013230837545732508
"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9507031,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,92360,148463823,0.034649269968050574
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,232986943,0.010058233485895877
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,338121506,0.020073046692595985
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9553862,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,171298,5678328,-0.0077460498842765665
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,673201228,-0.018125925195055025
"Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (ADRD) are now regarded as a public health problem of pressing importance. While the race for disease-altering treatments continues, another strand of work has focused on identifying social and psychological precursors of these conditions. Such biopsychosocial risks often can be traced back to phases of life that predate symptom onset by years or decades. Therefore, a robust social and life course epidemiology of ADRD requires study designs that feature a) broad and deep psychosocial characterization of b) a large, population-relevant cohort c) during early phases of life, with d) medically-documented outcome data. Parent project R01AG053155 features a) through c), specifically in 90,000 members of the Project Talent cohort assessed in 1960 and again in 1970-74. The current supplement expands its scope to all members of Project Talent baseline (roughly 340,000) from 1960, and focuses on two scientific aims. The first seeks to estimate the relative risk of ADRD by the early 70s arising from adolescent personality traits, as documented in Medicare data linked to the cohort. One key feature of this aim is to determine if aspects of personality in adolescence are associated with ADRD incidence in later life independently of adolescent IQ, which is a known predictor. The second key aspect of this aim is to use the size and population representativeness of the sample to derive reasonably precise population-relevant effect size estimates of personality relative risks, and compare these effect sizes to benchmark risk estimates of adolescent IQ and socioeconomic status, which are considered to have policy and public health significance. The second aim also leverages the size and scope of the sample to identify personality traits which may moderate the ADRD risk of low adolescent IQ, in more complex and realistic patterns than can be studied in smaller or less representative data sets. This is accomplished via machine learning methods focused on identifying non-linear interactions via intensive cross-validation, another scientific question that takes full advantage of the size and scope of this unique cohort. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias are on the rise, due to both increasing life spans and the size of the Baby Boom generation as it reaches these later years. While scientists have yet to develop cures for dementias, it may be possible to learn how to prevent or delay their onset by studying life circumstances that give rise to these conditions. The goal of this project is to determine how personality traits in adolescence may compensate for the dementia risk posed by low adolescence IQ scores.",Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life.,9688395,R01AG053155,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Baby Booms', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biopsychosocial', 'cohort', 'epidemiologic data', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'parent project', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,287001,179705973,-0.04204873278457667
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9706344,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,331584,641965656,0.03338595426739681
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement) Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Summary Dementia affects over 5 million older adults in the US, with vast implications for individual patients, their caregivers, and social programs designed to support increasing health care needs. Research to date has not fully clarified the role that multiple co-occurring chronic conditions (multimorbidity) play in the provision of appropriate care for racially and ethnically diverse groups of older adults with mild or more severe cognitive impairment. As a result, there is a need for greater understanding of the complex interactions between existing morbidity combinations, cognitive impairment, and the receipt of essential and appropriate care. As of yet, it is unclear whether specific multimorbidity combinations alongside cognitive impairment present greater difficulty in accessing good-quality, and appropriate care and preventive services among older adults from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The supplement extends from the research conducted in the parent award by focusing on older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and co-existing chronic conditions. The goal of this supplement is to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care received for older adults with dementia and competing multimorbidity care demands. We propose to use existing databases and multimorbidity combinations and patterns recently found in the parent grant. Our proposed research employs data from over 20 years of nationally-representative biennial surveys (~38,000 sampled people in the Health & Retirement Study) linked to Medicare claims. We propose two aims:  Aim 1. Determine racial and ethnic differences in receipt of preventive services among older adults with  mild or severe cognitive impairment and various multimorbidity combinations.  Aim 2. Evaluate racial and ethnic differences in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and  emergency department (ED) visits with discharge among older adults with mild or severe cognitive  impairment and various multimorbidity patterns. Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Narrative Our findings will inform policies and programs that seek to delay and avert costly and intensive levels of care among racially/ethnically diverse older adults with dementia. By identifying disease combinations with dementia associated with poor uptake of preventive services and high use of preventable hospital and emergency department services, future work can inform treatment decision-making and practice guidelines that are better attuned to the needs of vulnerable older adults with mild and severe cognitive decline.",Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement),9716886,R01AG055681,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Institutionalization', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'parent grant', 'premature', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,373593,304670088,-0.020178173203380858
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9463479,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2018,398926,14847250,0.015761469897710604
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9496395,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,618216,641965656,0.03338595426739681
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,276703803,-0.002141046983030501
"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,807432003,0.0007661078572893267
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,338121506,0.020073046692595985
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9339726,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,170236,5678328,-0.0077460498842765665
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,673201228,-0.018125925195055025
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry.

"Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS: also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder that is the third most common neurodegenerative disease of aging (after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). It is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors present prior to diagnosis that affect the risk of developing ALS, and to also identify factors that are associated with the length of survival with this uniformly fatal disease. We hope that this study will identify modifiable risk factors that pu people at risk for ALS so that we can prevent this disabling disease, and we believe that studying the factors that influence length of survival with ALS will lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival among patients with ALS.",Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS,9321614,R01TS000249,[' '],ATSDR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,400000,560644462,0.020475763049347177
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'cohesion', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,136810522,0.016480896133102968
"Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to investigate the potential role of fetal-maternal histocompatibility and other HLA relationships in maternal autoimmune disease. Female predominance, onset during childbearing years, and similarities to graft-versus-host disease have led to the hypothesis that natural processes during pregnancy such as the bi-directional cellular exchange between mother and fetus could be involved in the etiology of some autoimmune conditions. The presence of cells or tissues originating from a different individual is referred to as microchimerism (MC). Studies in scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have found higher number of fetal cells, or MC, in the maternal circulation years after birth compared to healthy controls. Fetal cells could potentially elicit a graft-versus-host or a host-versus-graft effect triggering autoimmune conditions. However, the overall reduction of risk of RA and SLE associated with parity and the amelioration of RA symptoms during pregnancy, suggest that exposure to fetal DNA could also be beneficial. Overall, the exact role of MC in disease etiology remains unknown. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in immunologic function and are important in immune recognition of self and non-self. Histocompatibility relationships are hypothesized to play a role in effect and persistence of fetal cells. The overall hypothesis of this project is tha the nature of the fetal-maternal histocompatibility relationship determines the effect of exposure to fetal cells on risk of disease. This project will use 4-digit HLA genotypes, detailed pregnancy histories, and clinical characteristics abstracted from medical records from ~900 RA cases, SLE cases and healthy controls (300 in each group), 1,500 of their children and 400 fathers to address three related hypotheses. First, cases are more likely to share a larger number of alleles at eight classical HLA loci compared to controls. Case-control differences will be tested using logistic regression, adjusting for known confounders and genetic ancestry. Second, women who do not have increased histocompatibility with any of their offspring have a later age of onset of RA and SLE compared to women who have compatible offspring. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a Cox-proportional hazards model with age of diagnosis as the event of interest. Third, cases are more likely to be HLA similar to their partners than controls since feta loss is associated with increased histocompatibility between mother and child, in addition to increased risk of RA and SLE. We will first estimate the association between reported number of pregnancies resulting in fetal loss and risk of disease. Second, we will measure the degree of genetic similarity between mating partners by estimating a relatedness coefficient R. Fetal-maternal influences mediated through classical HLA genotypes could provide new insight into the etiology of these debilitating conditions and others where pregnancy related factors are suspected.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases predominately affecting women of reproductive age. Microchimerism has emerged as a potentially relevant mechanism in disease etiology where fetal-maternal HLA relationships are likely to be involved. Better characterization of the effects of fetal-maternal histocompatibility will provide new information that will aid in our understandin of disease pathogenesis, provide important predictors for disease risk and help develop better therapeutic strategies.            ",Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease,9128403,F31AI116064,"['Aborted Fetus', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormonal', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Microchimerism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'cell mediated immune response', 'child bearing', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'graft vs host disease', 'hazard', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'offspring', 'parity', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'success']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,23668,148186688,-0.029888532678416676
"Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine leiomyoma (UL) are the most common pelvic tumor in women of reproductive age. Despite the fact that these smooth muscle tumors are benign, UL are a significant public health problem, accounting for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually, and approximately 1 in 4 women will have a UL that comes to clinical attention. Despite the high morbidity and health care costs associated with UL, the etiology is not understood, and few modifiable, protective risk factors have been identified. Dietary factors may play a role in UL etiology due to their potential to modify endogenous hormones as well as their inflammatory effects. Hypothesis/Specific Aims: Our overall hypothesis is that intake and plasma biomarker levels of dietary components that influence endogenous hormonal and inflammatory response are associated with UL risk. Few studies have examined the association between dietary factors and UL. To our knowledge, only one prospective cohort has examined the association between dairy and dietary fat intake and UL observing a reduced risk of UL with increasing dairy consumption and associations with some fatty acids. In addition, no prospective studies have examined the association with vitamin D levels. Using prospective data we will evaluate the following aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the association between dietary fat and risk of incident uterine leiomyoma using data among 97,807 women in the NHSII cohort who completed a dietary assessment. In a subset of these women we will examine the association between circulating fatty acid levels and uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 2. Dairy food intake is associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 3. Vitamin D levels are associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma. Study Design: The proposed study consists of Nurses' Health Study II participants who completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about their usual diet in 1991. Follow-up FFQs were completed in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. Quintiles or categories of dietary intake will be generated and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios of UL incidence associated with each of the dietary factors. Among a subset of women with pre-diagnostic biomarkers, the association between plasma vitamin D and circulating fatty acids with UL risk will be assessed with logistic regression models. The presence of prospectively collected UL, dietary, and covariate data and stored blood samples, allows cost-efficient and valid consideration of the temporality of disease diagnosis - supporting the potential identification of modifiable risk factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study provides us with the opportunity to examine the association between diet, a potentially modifiable risk factor, and uterine fibroids, a highly prevalent but understudied condition. We believe this study would be the first study to examine the relation between dietary fat intake and vitamin D levels and uterine fibroids. The results of this study have the potential to inform prevention strategies for a condition which accounts for $2.2 billion in health care costs annually.    	            ",Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids,9039487,R03HD081064,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Accounting', 'African American', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dairy Products', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fibroid Tumor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hysterectomy', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infertility', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle Tumor', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Trans Fats', 'Trans Fatty Acids', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterine Fibroids', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamins', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'calcium intake', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost efficient', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'modifiable risk', 'monounsaturated fat', 'mouse model', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'saturated fat', 'screening', 'steroid hormone', 'study population', 'tumor']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2016,48461,327644200,0.03579652102521496
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,9068774,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteoporotic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2016,91800,558628098,0.0031394449090494277
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,338121506,0.020073046692595985
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9222881,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,168375,5678328,-0.0077460498842765665
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,9099872,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,194340,86807134,0.01117625051840072
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,673201228,-0.018125925195055025
"Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS: also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder that is the third most common neurodegenerative disease of aging (after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). It is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors present prior to diagnosis that affect the risk of developing ALS, and to also identify factors that are associated with the length of survival with this uniformly fatal disease. We hope that this study will identify modifiable risk factors that pu people at risk for ALS so that we can prevent this disabling disease, and we believe that studying the factors that influence length of survival with ALS will lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival among patients with ALS.",Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS,9143771,R01TS000249,[' '],ATSDR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,400000,560644462,0.020475763049347177
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9041015,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2016,474831,14847250,0.015761469897710604
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,9124715,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,499814,111231681,0.03262021326688688
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.            ",Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment,9082891,R01DK109008,"['Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Assessment', 'Shapes', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Video Games', 'Visceral', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disorder prevention', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'sex', 'subcutaneous', 'tool', 'waist circumference', 'whole body imaging']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,706716,685608202,0.03450486779147033
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'aging population', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,136810522,0.016480896133102968
"Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to investigate the potential role of fetal-maternal histocompatibility and other HLA relationships in maternal autoimmune disease. Female predominance, onset during childbearing years, and similarities to graft-versus-host disease have led to the hypothesis that natural processes during pregnancy such as the bi-directional cellular exchange between mother and fetus could be involved in the etiology of some autoimmune conditions. The presence of cells or tissues originating from a different individual is referred to as microchimerism (MC). Studies in scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have found higher number of fetal cells, or MC, in the maternal circulation years after birth compared to healthy controls. Fetal cells could potentially elicit a graft-versus-host or a host-versus-graft effect triggering autoimmune conditions. However, the overall reduction of risk of RA and SLE associated with parity and the amelioration of RA symptoms during pregnancy, suggest that exposure to fetal DNA could also be beneficial. Overall, the exact role of MC in disease etiology remains unknown. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in immunologic function and are important in immune recognition of self and non-self. Histocompatibility relationships are hypothesized to play a role in effect and persistence of fetal cells. The overall hypothesis of this project is tha the nature of the fetal-maternal histocompatibility relationship determines the effect of exposure to fetal cells on risk of disease. This project will use 4-digit HLA genotypes, detailed pregnancy histories, and clinical characteristics abstracted from medical records from ~900 RA cases, SLE cases and healthy controls (300 in each group), 1,500 of their children and 400 fathers to address three related hypotheses. First, cases are more likely to share a larger number of alleles at eight classical HLA loci compared to controls. Case-control differences will be tested using logistic regression, adjusting for known confounders and genetic ancestry. Second, women who do not have increased histocompatibility with any of their offspring have a later age of onset of RA and SLE compared to women who have compatible offspring. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a Cox-proportional hazards model with age of diagnosis as the event of interest. Third, cases are more likely to be HLA similar to their partners than controls since feta loss is associated with increased histocompatibility between mother and child, in addition to increased risk of RA and SLE. We will first estimate the association between reported number of pregnancies resulting in fetal loss and risk of disease. Second, we will measure the degree of genetic similarity between mating partners by estimating a relatedness coefficient R. Fetal-maternal influences mediated through classical HLA genotypes could provide new insight into the etiology of these debilitating conditions and others where pregnancy related factors are suspected.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases predominately affecting women of reproductive age. Microchimerism has emerged as a potentially relevant mechanism in disease etiology where fetal-maternal HLA relationships are likely to be involved. Better characterization of the effects of fetal-maternal histocompatibility will provide new information that will aid in our understandin of disease pathogenesis, provide important predictors for disease risk and help develop better therapeutic strategies.            ",Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease,8987418,F31AI116064,"['Aborted Fetus', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormonal', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Microchimerism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'cell mediated immune response', 'child bearing', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'graft vs host disease', 'hazard', 'human leukocyte antigen gene', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'offspring', 'parity', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'success']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2015,37873,148186688,-0.029888532678416676
"Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine leiomyoma (UL) are the most common pelvic tumor in women of reproductive age. Despite the fact that these smooth muscle tumors are benign, UL are a significant public health problem, accounting for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually, and approximately 1 in 4 women will have a UL that comes to clinical attention. Despite the high morbidity and health care costs associated with UL, the etiology is not understood, and few modifiable, protective risk factors have been identified. Dietary factors may play a role in UL etiology due to their potential to modify endogenous hormones as well as their inflammatory effects. Hypothesis/Specific Aims: Our overall hypothesis is that intake and plasma biomarker levels of dietary components that influence endogenous hormonal and inflammatory response are associated with UL risk. Few studies have examined the association between dietary factors and UL. To our knowledge, only one prospective cohort has examined the association between dairy and dietary fat intake and UL observing a reduced risk of UL with increasing dairy consumption and associations with some fatty acids. In addition, no prospective studies have examined the association with vitamin D levels. Using prospective data we will evaluate the following aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the association between dietary fat and risk of incident uterine leiomyoma using data among 97,807 women in the NHSII cohort who completed a dietary assessment. In a subset of these women we will examine the association between circulating fatty acid levels and uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 2. Dairy food intake is associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 3. Vitamin D levels are associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma. Study Design: The proposed study consists of Nurses' Health Study II participants who completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about their usual diet in 1991. Follow-up FFQs were completed in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. Quintiles or categories of dietary intake will be generated and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios of UL incidence associated with each of the dietary factors. Among a subset of women with pre-diagnostic biomarkers, the association between plasma vitamin D and circulating fatty acids with UL risk will be assessed with logistic regression models. The presence of prospectively collected UL, dietary, and covariate data and stored blood samples, allows cost-efficient and valid consideration of the temporality of disease diagnosis - supporting the potential identification of modifiable risk factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study provides us with the opportunity to examine the association between diet, a potentially modifiable risk factor, and uterine fibroids, a highly prevalent but understudied condition. We believe this study would be the first study to examine the relation between dietary fat intake and vitamin D levels and uterine fibroids. The results of this study have the potential to inform prevention strategies for a condition which accounts for $2.2 billion in health care costs annually.    	            ",Dietary factors and risk of uterine fibroids,8890403,R03HD081064,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Accounting', 'African American', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dairy Products', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fibroid Tumor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hysterectomy', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infertility', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Population Study', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle Tumor', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Trans Fats', 'Trans Fatty Acids', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterine Fibroids', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamins', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'calcium intake', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'modifiable risk', 'monounsaturated fat', 'mouse model', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'saturated fat', 'screening', 'steroid hormone', 'tumor']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2015,88625,327644200,0.03579652102521496
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,558628098,0.0031394449090494277
"Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth. However randomized trials of treating BV to prevent preterm birth have produced mixed results. Systematic reviews using aggregate study data found no overall benefit of treatment, but raised possibilities of benefit to women at high preterm birth risk treatd at <20 weeks' gestation. To overcome the limitations of conventional meta- analysis, we propose pooling the raw data from the trials in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Using pooled raw data, we will have greater power to evaluate the benefit of treatment of BV in subgroups of individuals and measure the days of pregnancy prolongation in treated and untreated women. Use of aggregate data does not facilitate analyses based on individual patient characteristics, such as gestational age at randomization, as is possible with individual data. In particular, we will investigate the interaction between gestational age at treatment and a priori risk of preterm birth on prolongation of pregnancy. We have commitments from 10 study PIs, representing 72% of women randomized in all the trials, to provide data and help understand variables and analyses reported from their studies. Preparing the data for analysis and harmonizing variables across studies is a major effort. Our team has extensive experience and expertise in maternal fetal medicine in general and preterm birth and BV in particular as well as database management and statistics. Missing data methods, including multiple imputation, will be employed for some variables. Logistic regression models with random effects for specific studies and interactions between treatment (drug/placebo), gestational age at randomization, and a priori risk will be fit to identify subgroups of pregnant women in whom the risk of preterm birth is reduced. Time to event (i.e., birth) models with random effects and interactions will be used to estimate the number of days of pregnancy prolongation attributable to treatment of BV in pregnant women. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the influence of single studies, inclusion of aggregate as well as individual data, and statistical models. Developments in this area have utilized Bayesian hierarchical models, which have the flexibility to incorporate data of different types. Computations will employ Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation in R and WinBugs. Statistical methods will be extended as appropriate. This project is novel in at least three ways: a unique collection of data sets and major effort to combine them, unique analyses of the impact of BV treatment on preterm birth, and unique sensitivity analyses and statistical methods. We expect to identify subgroups of women who benefit from treatment and the optimal window to initiate treatment and to have a significant positive impact on maternal and child health through screening and treatment recommendations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth, a leading cause of infant mortality. Randomized trials and reviews using aggregate data have produced mixed results.

"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,86807134,0.01117625051840072
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS: also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder that is the third most common neurodegenerative disease of aging (after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). It is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors present prior to diagnosis that affect the risk of developing ALS, and to also identify factors that are associated with the length of survival with this uniformly fatal disease. We hope that this study will identify modifiable risk factors that pu people at risk for ALS so that we can prevent this disabling disease, and we believe that studying the factors that influence length of survival with ALS will lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival among patients with ALS.            ",Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS,9048445,R01TS000249,[' '],ATSDR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,400000,560644462,0.020475763049347177
"Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fractures are a significant cause of disability and mortality in older persons. The most common tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis and prediction of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Yet, up to half of individuals suffering a hip fracture do not have osteoporosis by BMD testing; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. This underscores the importance of looking for additional contributors to fracture risk, such as reduced soft tissue thickness at the trochanter, which attenuates the fall forces that may lead to fracture. According to biomechanical principles, when the ratio of applied force to bone strength, (termed the 'Factor-of-Risk'), exceeds one, a fracture will occur. Two previous studies have examined the Factor-of-Risk along with trochanteric soft tissue thickness but had only small numbers of hip fractures, and conflicting results. To better understand the factors associated with hip fracture, we propose to use a biomechanical approach to assess hip fracture risk that includes both estimated forces applied to the hip during a sideways fall as well as the strength of the proximal femur. The specific goal is to investigate the contribution of trochanteric soft tissue thickness t hip fracture risk, and to include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model. We hypothesize these factors predict hip fracture, and further that the factor-of-risk prediction of hip fracture isk will prove better than BMD assessment alone and better than the World Health Organization FRAX tool. We will identify prospectively ascertained hip fracture cases from three cohorts (Framingham Study, MrOS, Rancho Bernardo Study) and from each cohort also select up to four sex- and age-matched (within 3-years) non-fracture cohort members as controls, using the case-cohort study design to increase efficiency. Soft tissue thickness in 2,435 individuals will be assess on whole body DXA scans obtained at the earliest time in each cohort before any subsequent hip fracture occurred. Relative risks will be assessed as odds ratios using conditional logistic regression. This study has potential to significantly alter the way hip fractue risk is currently being assessed, and thus how patients are selected for drug therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common tool to diagnose osteoporosis/predict hip fracture risk is bone density testing, and yet, up to half of adults suffering a hip fracture do no have osteoporosis by this test; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. We will investigate the role of trochanteric soft tissue thickness to hip fracture risk, an include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model, to examine if they will predict hip fracture and further do so better than currently available prediction tools, providing new public health insights",Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach,8829750,R01AR060816,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Femur', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hip region structure', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Smoking Status', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trochanters', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'diagnosis standard', 'disability', 'falls', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'men', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'tool']",NIAMS,HEBREW REHABILITATION CENTER FOR AGED,R01,2015,473892,10587954,0.01482808244680491
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,8901862,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,499998,111231681,0.03262021326688688
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.            ",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,8888896,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2015,514370,14847250,0.015761469897710604
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,136810522,0.016480896133102968
"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques.   Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one. The Surgeon General's report (2001), ""Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity - A supplement to mental health,"" highlighted understanding the protective and risk factors for comorbid conditions among Blacks, as an emergent public health research priority",Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De,8687991,K22MD003934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'African Caribbean', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Career Transition Award', 'Client', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Employment Status', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'Inequality', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Social Health Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uninsured', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'programs', 'public health research', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'trend']",NIMHD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,K22,2014,192912,9804373,0.021635326918318
"Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth. However randomized trials of treating BV to prevent preterm birth have produced mixed results. Systematic reviews using aggregate study data found no overall benefit of treatment, but raised possibilities of benefit to women at high preterm birth risk treatd at <20 weeks' gestation. To overcome the limitations of conventional meta- analysis, we propose pooling the raw data from the trials in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Using pooled raw data, we will have greater power to evaluate the benefit of treatment of BV in subgroups of individuals and measure the days of pregnancy prolongation in treated and untreated women. Use of aggregate data does not facilitate analyses based on individual patient characteristics, such as gestational age at randomization, as is possible with individual data. In particular, we will investigate the interaction between gestational age at treatment and a priori risk of preterm birth on prolongation of pregnancy. We have commitments from 10 study PIs, representing 72% of women randomized in all the trials, to provide data and help understand variables and analyses reported from their studies. Preparing the data for analysis and harmonizing variables across studies is a major effort. Our team has extensive experience and expertise in maternal fetal medicine in general and preterm birth and BV in particular as well as database management and statistics. Missing data methods, including multiple imputation, will be employed for some variables. Logistic regression models with random effects for specific studies and interactions between treatment (drug/placebo), gestational age at randomization, and a priori risk will be fit to identify subgroups of pregnant women in whom the risk of preterm birth is reduced. Time to event (i.e., birth) models with random effects and interactions will be used to estimate the number of days of pregnancy prolongation attributable to treatment of BV in pregnant women. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the influence of single studies, inclusion of aggregate as well as individual data, and statistical models. Developments in this area have utilized Bayesian hierarchical models, which have the flexibility to incorporate data of different types. Computations will employ Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation in R and WinBugs. Statistical methods will be extended as appropriate. This project is novel in at least three ways: a unique collection of data sets and major effort to combine them, unique analyses of the impact of BV treatment on preterm birth, and unique sensitivity analyses and statistical methods. We expect to identify subgroups of women who benefit from treatment and the optimal window to initiate treatment and to have a significant positive impact on maternal and child health through screening and treatment recommendations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth, a leading cause of infant mortality.

"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).

"Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fractures are a significant cause of disability and mortality in older persons. The most common tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis and prediction of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Yet, up to half of individuals suffering a hip fracture do not have osteoporosis by BMD testing; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. This underscores the importance of looking for additional contributors to fracture risk, such as reduced soft tissue thickness at the trochanter, which attenuates the fall forces that may lead to fracture. According to biomechanical principles, when the ratio of applied force to bone strength, (termed the 'Factor-of-Risk'), exceeds one, a fracture will occur. Two previous studies have examined the Factor-of-Risk along with trochanteric soft tissue thickness but had only small numbers of hip fractures, and conflicting results. To better understand the factors associated with hip fracture, we propose to use a biomechanical approach to assess hip fracture risk that includes both estimated forces applied to the hip during a sideways fall as well as the strength of the proximal femur. The specific goal is to investigate the contribution of trochanteric soft tissue thickness t hip fracture risk, and to include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model. We hypothesize these factors predict hip fracture, and further that the factor-of-risk prediction of hip fracture isk will prove better than BMD assessment alone and better than the World Health Organization FRAX tool. We will identify prospectively ascertained hip fracture cases from three cohorts (Framingham Study, MrOS, Rancho Bernardo Study) and from each cohort also select up to four sex- and age-matched (within 3-years) non-fracture cohort members as controls, using the case-cohort study design to increase efficiency. Soft tissue thickness in 2,435 individuals will be assess on whole body DXA scans obtained at the earliest time in each cohort before any subsequent hip fracture occurred. Relative risks will be assessed as odds ratios using conditional logistic regression. This study has potential to significantly alter the way hip fractue risk is currently being assessed, and thus how patients are selected for drug therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common tool to diagnose osteoporosis/predict hip fracture risk is bone density testing, and yet, up to half of adults suffering a hip fracture do no have osteoporosis by this test; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. We will investigate the role of trochanteric soft tissue thickness to hip fracture risk, an include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model, to examine if they will predict hip fracture and further do so better than currently available prediction tools, providing new public health insights            ",Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach,8628044,R01AR060816,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Femur', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hip region structure', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Smoking Status', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trochanters', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'diagnosis standard', 'disability', 'falls', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'men', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'tool']",NIAMS,HEBREW REHABILITATION CENTER FOR AGED,R01,2014,477496,10587954,0.01482808244680491
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.

"Project START: Screening to Augment Referral to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse is associated with high costs to individuals and to society but less than one- third of individuals who are drug dependent and 6% of those who abuse drugs ever receives treatment. Screening, a brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT) for substance abuse and deployed in a primary care setting has therapeutic potential but clinicians typically have less than 10 minutes with a patient and must address a range of medical problems. SBIRT, delivered by computer or nurse, would be a strong addition to a primary care clinician's therapeutic armamentarium for substance abusers but these interventions need to be tested against usual care. Women, who have lower rates of substance abuse treatment, typically receive primary medical care in a reproductive health setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal screening to determine if women abuse substances but, other than for alcohol and tobacco, there are no empirical data to support the effectiveness of this approach. In fact, the astonishing lack of data on SBIRT in primary care setting is noted by the US Preventative Services Task Force, in a 2008 report. We propose a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that would compare two SBIRTs, offered either by computer or a trained nurse, to usual care (a control condition). We will recruit 660 women with a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, opiates, prescription drugs) and randomize them to a nurse- administered referral based upon motivation principles, a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice. All subjects will receive a pamphlet with information and resources. Random effects and logistic regression models will be used to estimate group differences in primary drug used, treatment initiation, and treatment attendance among the 3 groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Random effects models will also be used to test the incremental costs of the computer and nurse administered referrals.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users. We propose a pragmatic trial that would randomize 660 women in a reproductive health setting who have a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) problems to a nurse-administered referral based upon motivation principles, or a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice (control condition).

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8617361,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2014,2047726,136810522,0.016480896133102968
"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques.  Project Narrative Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one.

"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.        The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors. (2) To evaluate the potential influence of other psychiatric disorders in the development of CUDs.

"Cumulative Glycemic Burden and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to provide evidence that prolonged, continuous, tight glycemic control, initiated when type 2 diabetes (DM) is first diagnosed and maintained throughout patients' DM lifetime, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current recommendations on care for persons with DM include tight glycated hemoglobin (A1C) control (<7%) as a means to reduce risk of CVD and other complications. Recent studies raised questions about this recommendation by failing to demonstrate that tight A1C control provides CV benefit in persons with DM, but these studies could not account for glycemic control prior to trial initiation. Other research supports the benefit of tight glycemic control over time, and suggests that even moderately elevated A1C levels in the 'normal' range indicate long-term CVD risk. To address these seemingly contradictory perspectives on how to optimize DM care, we propose to test the hypothesis that tight glycemic control does indeed reduce CVD risk, if begun early and continued throughout the course of DM. We will also assess whether cumulative glycemic burden over time, predict long-term CVD risk better than current A1C level or mean A1C over time, and to identify threshold levels of cumulative glycemic burden at which CVD risk becomes markedly elevated, among persons with DM. We will conduct the proposed analyses using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Diabetes Registry. Since 1988, KPNW has developed and maintained this highly specific, sensitive, data-rich registry of members with DM; as of December 2009, it contained data on >70,000 persons. Among adults who joined the registry in 1995-2010, we will identify individuals who experienced a CVD event and match them to 5 controls who did not. We will then conduct multivariate logistic regression analyses of the extent to which A1C, mean A1C, and cumulative A1C burden predict time until first CVD event, and describe differences in the odds of CVD from date of DM diagnosis through 2010, to identify cut-points (of A1C, mean A1C over time, and cumulative glycemic burden levels) where CVD risk increases. The clinical application of such findings would lie in proving what has long been suspected - that cumulative glycemic burden is a critical CVD risk factor - thus providing critical support for the importance of initiating tight glycemic control immediately upon DM diagnosis and maintaining such control rigorously. No previous studies have evaluated cumulative glycemic burden as an indicator of CVD risk in DM, alone or in comparison to mean A1C over time, despite cumulative burden's biological plausibility as a CVD risk factor. The proposed work builds on our previous development of methods for measuring cumulative glycemic burden.        This study will use existing data on Kaiser Permanente Northwest members with diabetes from 1995- 2010 to assess whether control of high blood sugar, if begun early and continued over time, reduces cardiovascular disease risk. We will use a novel measure of high blood sugar, glycemic burden, which accounts for how high blood sugar is and how long it has been high. Our results would show the importance of treating blood sugar aggressively immediately upon diabetes diagnosis and maintaining such aggressive treatment rigorously.

"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.            ",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,8549163,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,499998,111231681,0.03262021326688688
"Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fractures are a significant cause of disability and mortality in older persons. The most common tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis and prediction of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Yet, up to half of individuals suffering a hip fracture do not have osteoporosis by BMD testing; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. This underscores the importance of looking for additional contributors to fracture risk, such as reduced soft tissue thickness at the trochanter, which attenuates the fall forces that may lead to fracture. According to biomechanical principles, when the ratio of applied force to bone strength, (termed the 'Factor-of-Risk'), exceeds one, a fracture will occur. Two previous studies have examined the Factor-of-Risk along with trochanteric soft tissue thickness but had only small numbers of hip fractures, and conflicting results. To better understand the factors associated with hip fracture, we propose to use a biomechanical approach to assess hip fracture risk that includes both estimated forces applied to the hip during a sideways fall as well as the strength of the proximal femur. The specific goal is to investigate the contribution of trochanteric soft tissue thickness t hip fracture risk, and to include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model. We hypothesize these factors predict hip fracture, and further that the factor-of-risk prediction of hip fracture isk will prove better than BMD assessment alone and better than the World Health Organization FRAX tool. We will identify prospectively ascertained hip fracture cases from three cohorts (Framingham Study, MrOS, Rancho Bernardo Study) and from each cohort also select up to four sex- and age-matched (within 3-years) non-fracture cohort members as controls, using the case-cohort study design to increase efficiency. Soft tissue thickness in 2,435 individuals will be assess on whole body DXA scans obtained at the earliest time in each cohort before any subsequent hip fracture occurred. Relative risks will be assessed as odds ratios using conditional logistic regression. This study has potential to significantly alter the way hip fractue risk is currently being assessed, and thus how patients are selected for drug therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common tool to diagnose osteoporosis/predict hip fracture risk is bone density testing, and yet, up to half of adults suffering a hip fracture do no have osteoporosis by this test; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. We will investigate the role of trochanteric soft tissue thickness to hip fracture risk, an include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model, to examine if they will predict hip fracture and further do so better than currently available prediction tools, providing new public health insights            ",Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach,8503790,R01AR060816,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Femur', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hip region structure', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Smoking Status', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trochanters', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'diagnosis standard', 'disability', 'falls', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'men', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'tool']",NIAMS,HEBREW REHABILITATION CENTER FOR AGED,R01,2013,586894,10587954,0.01482808244680491
"Project START: Screening to Augment Referral to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse is associated with high costs to individuals and to society but less than one- third of individuals who are drug dependent and 6% of those who abuse drugs ever receives treatment. Screening, a brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT) for substance abuse and deployed in a primary care setting has therapeutic potential but clinicians typically have less than 10 minutes with a patient and must address a range of medical problems. SBIRT, delivered by computer or nurse, would be a strong addition to a primary care clinician's therapeutic armamentarium for substance abusers but these interventions need to be tested against usual care. Women, who have lower rates of substance abuse treatment, typically receive primary medical care in a reproductive health setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal screening to determine if women abuse substances but, other than for alcohol and tobacco, there are no empirical data to support the effectiveness of this approach. In fact, the astonishing lack of data on SBIRT in primary care setting is noted by the US Preventative Services Task Force, in a 2008 report. We propose a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that would compare two SBIRTs, offered either by computer or a trained nurse, to usual care (a control condition). We will recruit 660 women with a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, opiates, prescription drugs) and randomize them to a nurse- administered referral based upon motivation principles, a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice. All subjects will receive a pamphlet with information and resources. Random effects and logistic regression models will be used to estimate group differences in primary drug used, treatment initiation, and treatment attendance among the 3 groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Random effects models will also be used to test the incremental costs of the computer and nurse administered referrals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users. We propose a pragmatic trial that would randomize 660 women in a reproductive health setting who have a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) problems to a nurse-administered referral based upon motivation principles, or a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice (control condition). Costs of the conditions would be estimated to provide models of cost effectiveness.

"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques. Project Narrative Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Cumulative Glycemic Burden and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to provide evidence that prolonged, continuous, tight glycemic control, initiated when type 2 diabetes (DM) is first diagnosed and maintained throughout patients' DM lifetime, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current recommendations on care for persons with DM include tight glycated hemoglobin (A1C) control (<7%) as a means to reduce risk of CVD and other complications. Recent studies raised questions about this recommendation by failing to demonstrate that tight A1C control provides CV benefit in persons with DM, but these studies could not account for glycemic control prior to trial initiation. Other research supports the benefit of tight glycemic control over time, and suggests that even moderately elevated A1C levels in the 'normal' range indicate long-term CVD risk. To address these seemingly contradictory perspectives on how to optimize DM care, we propose to test the hypothesis that tight glycemic control does indeed reduce CVD risk, if begun early and continued throughout the course of DM. We will also assess whether cumulative glycemic burden over time, predict long-term CVD risk better than current A1C level or mean A1C over time, and to identify threshold levels of cumulative glycemic burden at which CVD risk becomes markedly elevated, among persons with DM. We will conduct the proposed analyses using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Diabetes Registry. Since 1988, KPNW has developed and maintained this highly specific, sensitive, data-rich registry of members with DM; as of December 2009, it contained data on >70,000 persons. Among adults who joined the registry in 1995-2010, we will identify individuals who experienced a CVD event and match them to 5 controls who did not. We will then conduct multivariate logistic regression analyses of the extent to which A1C, mean A1C, and cumulative A1C burden predict time until first CVD event, and describe differences in the odds of CVD from date of DM diagnosis through 2010, to identify cut-points (of A1C, mean A1C over time, and cumulative glycemic burden levels) where CVD risk increases. The clinical application of such findings would lie in proving what has long been suspected - that cumulative glycemic burden is a critical CVD risk factor - thus providing critical support for the importance of initiating tight glycemic control immediately upon DM diagnosis and maintaining such control rigorously. No previous studies have evaluated cumulative glycemic burden as an indicator of CVD risk in DM, alone or in comparison to mean A1C over time, despite cumulative burden's biological plausibility as a CVD risk factor. The proposed work builds on our previous development of methods for measuring cumulative glycemic burden.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will use existing data on Kaiser Permanente Northwest members with diabetes from 1995- 2010 to assess whether control of high blood sugar, if begun early and continued over time, reduces cardiovascular disease risk. We will use a novel measure of high blood sugar, glycemic burden, which accounts for how high blood sugar is and how long it has been high. Our results would show the importance of treating blood sugar aggressively immediately upon diabetes diagnosis and maintaining such aggressive treatment rigorously.              This study will use existing data on Kaiser Permanente Northwest members with diabetes from 1995- 2010 to assess whether control of high blood sugar, if begun early and continued over time, reduces cardiovascular disease risk.

"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors. (2) To evaluate the potential influence of other psychiatric disorders in the development of CUDs.           The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.              Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.            ",Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction,8373032,R01CA163687,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Mastectomy', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,335601,685608202,-0.03351568683427962
"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".

"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.              The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.            ",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,8350415,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2012,487267,111231681,0.030990259470697265
"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.

"Project START: Screening to Augment Referral to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse is associated with high costs to individuals and to society but less than one- third of individuals who are drug dependent and 6% of those who abuse drugs ever receives treatment. Screening, a brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT) for substance abuse and deployed in a primary care setting has therapeutic potential but clinicians typically have less than 10 minutes with a patient and must address a range of medical problems. SBIRT, delivered by computer or nurse, would be a strong addition to a primary care clinician's therapeutic armamentarium for substance abusers but these interventions need to be tested against usual care. Women, who have lower rates of substance abuse treatment, typically receive primary medical care in a reproductive health setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal screening to determine if women abuse substances but, other than for alcohol and tobacco, there are no empirical data to support the effectiveness of this approach. In fact, the astonishing lack of data on SBIRT in primary care setting is noted by the US Preventative Services Task Force, in a 2008 report. We propose a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that would compare two SBIRTs, offered either by computer or a trained nurse, to usual care (a control condition). We will recruit 660 women with a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, opiates, prescription drugs) and randomize them to a nurse- administered referral based upon motivation principles, a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice. All subjects will receive a pamphlet with information and resources. Random effects and logistic regression models will be used to estimate group differences in primary drug used, treatment initiation, and treatment attendance among the 3 groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Random effects models will also be used to test the incremental costs of the computer and nurse administered referrals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users. We propose a pragmatic trial that would randomize 660 women in a reproductive health setting who have a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) problems to a nurse-administered referral based upon motivation principles, or a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice (control condition).

"Longitudinal effects of custody loss on drug use and crime of African American wo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present study is to understand how custody loss is related to substance use and criminal behavior among African American women who are mothers across criminal offender status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans disproportionately experience child welfare and criminal justice system involvement as a result of drug misuse. Very limited scientific data is available to help understand the effect of custody loss on a woman's subsequent substance use and crime. Prominent on NIDA's research agenda is the promotion of research addressing health disparities and vulnerabilities among minority populations. The proposed project addresses a facet of this mission by examining custody loss as a predictor of increased substance use and criminal behavior among African American women. Specifically, the main objectives of this project are to identify risk factors for custody loss in this population and to assess the substance use and criminal behavior-related outcomes of custody loss. Because children are a significant source of social support for mothers, the loss of such support is likely to increase dependence upon other sources of support such as family and friends. When this support is adequate, women may be less likely to increase their substance use and criminal behavior after losing custody. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in the substance use and criminal behavior outcomes of custody loss among African American women and uncover disparities among drug using and non-drug using women across three levels of criminal justice involvement (n=200 per group): prison, probation, and community (no criminal justice involvement). Data for analyses will be derived from Waves 1-3 of the ""African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, and Criminality"" study (also known as ""B-WISE""; NIDA R01-DA22967), an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 African American women. All women are interviewed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after the initial interview. The specific aims of the present study are (1) To describe the characteristics of African American women who have lost custody of their children, compared to women who have not; (2) To examine the mediating effect of custody loss on the relationship between individual level factors (criminal justice and drug user status) and changes in substance use and criminal behavior over the 12-month study time frame; and (3) To determine if characteristics of the child, the custody loss event, and perceptions of social support are significant predictors of a change in substance use and criminal behavior after losing custody. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to estimate the impact of factors such as social support, criminal justice status, characteristic of the child, and characteristics of the custody loss event on post-custody loss changes in drug use and crime. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide data for criminal justice system and child welfare system policy for the prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American mothers who are substance users.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to uncover disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status, prior to and after losing custody. This knowledge can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice and child welfare systems-level interventions targeted at early detection and treatment of substance abuse that utilize women's sources of social support as allies.

"Prescription Psychotherapeutic Drug Use Among Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence (not taking drug as prescribed dose) is a significant public health concern. Older adults are frequently prescribed psychotherapeutic drugs including opioids (pain relievers) and central nervous system (CNS) depressants (tranquilizers and sedatives). Older adults are particularly susceptible to adverse medical outcomes from prescription drug abuse, as well as drug interactions due to age-related physiologic changes in body composition and drug metabolism. Negative consequences are even more adverse when older adults abuse more than one type of psychotherapeutic drug or simultaneously use psychotherapeutic drugs and alcohol. However, little is known about risk factors for prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence and the combined use of prescription drug and alcohol. In addition, few screening tools related to drug abuse have been validated in this population. Findings of this study will lead to clinical recommendations for early identification of older adults who may be at risk for psychotherapeutic drugs non-adherence or abuse, relevant to the missions of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The purpose of this study is to describe different patterns of adherence to prescription psychotherapeutic drugs and determine the risk factors of non-adherence among older adults. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) examine the psychometric properties of the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measuring prescription drug adherence among older adults; (2) to describe patterns of adherence to prescription psychotherapeutic drug and combined use of psychotherapeutic drug and alcohol among older adults; and (3) identify risk factors of psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults. This ongoing study is a cross-sectional design. Eligibility criteria include older adults who are 65 or older, taking at least one type of prescription psychotherapeutic drug, and able to communicate. One hundred and fifty participants will be recruited for this study. Participants will be recruited from the outpatient clinics at the VA Western New York Health System (VAWHYHS), Buffalo VA, senior centers, and senior apartments. Instruments include demographic questionnaire, Timeline Followback (TLFB) measuring medication adherence and alcohol use, Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 (DAST-10), Medication Adherence Scale (MAS), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Perceived Health Status (SF-12), and Belief of Medication Questionnaire (BMQ). Descriptive and correlational statistics will be used for data analysis. Logistic regression will be performed to identify significant predictors of prescription drug non-adherence. This pilot study seeks to gain new insight regarding prescription drug non-adherence and the combined use of prescription drugs and alcohol, as well as contributing factors of non-adherence in older adults. This project initiates a program of research that will ultimately lead to the development of interventions for monitoring prescription drug adherence among older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults is a growing public health concern. Understanding how older adults adhere to these addictive medications will provide clinicians useful information to better identify older adults who may be at risk for harm related to their non-adherence to prescription drug regimens. Clinicians need to routinely screen medication-taking behaviors among older adults who are prescribed psychotherapeutic drug in order to practice prevention and early intervention.           Project Narrative Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults is a growing public health concern.

"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in women: reproductive, hormonal and genetic factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in women: reproductive, hormonal and genetic factors Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in U.S. adults and has a higher incidence in men than in women (ratio of 1.4:1). Although several studies have investigated the association between reproductive factors and exogenous sex-hormone exposures to explain this sex differential, results have been varied and no comprehensive assessment of relevant epidemiologic and genetic factors related to risk of NHL and NHL subtypes has been conducted. Our innovative analyses will leverage NCI funding by using epidemiologic and genetic data already collected in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) determine whether endogenous and exogenous hormone exposures in women are associated with risk of NHL and common NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to steroidogenesis or that function in the same immune- related biologic pathways as sex-hormones, alter the association between factors in Aim 1 and risk of NHL and NHL subtypes. SNPs in sex-hormone genes of interest include estrogen receptors (ESR), cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and in immune/inflammatory pathways include interleukins (IL), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-:B), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-1) and lymphotoxin alpha (LTA). Risk of NHL also has been associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and some autoimmune conditions with each in turn associated with levels and circulation of sex- hormones. Therefore, BMI and autoimmune conditions will be carefully assessed as potential confounders and effect modifiers of the association between hormonal effects and NHL risk. Parsimonious multivariable unconditional logistic regression models will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk. Gene- environment interactions will be evaluated for exposures and SNPs in genes that function in the same biologic pathways, e.g. pregnancy-related factors, and SNPs in IL-10, TNF-1, ESR1 and ESR2. False discovery rate methods will be used to control for multiple hypothesis testing. The study's major strengths are: 1) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the association between sex-hormone s and NHL susceptibility; 2) already collected rich epidemiologic dataset including extensive reproductive history, sex-steroid hormone use, autoimmune conditions and BMI available to evaluate main effects, confounding and effect modification; 5) pathological confirmation and NHL subtype classification using the WHO classification; 6) data will be pooled for future analyses within the InterLymph Consortium allowing analyses of rare subtypes and exposure. Clarifying the role of these sex-hormone related factors in NHL risk will improve our understanding of lymphomagenesis, generate hypotheses for future research and be directly applicable to screening and prevention programs to reduce NHL incidence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is higher in men than in women and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions. Given that sex-hormones impact immune function, it is plausible that hormonal-related exposures and conditions that differ between women and men may help explain the observed sex-difference in NHL. Analyses that clarify the association among reproductive factors, use of estrogen-related therapies and risk of NHL and NHL subtypes in women and whether the relationship between NHL risk and sex-related hormones is altered by variation in genes important in hormone metabolism/production and immune function will improve our understanding of NHL development, help to generate new hypotheses for future research and will be directly applicable to prevention, intervention and screening programs with a goal to reduce NHL incidence.           Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is higher in men than in women and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions.

"Energy balance and nutrigenetic analysis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Energy balance and nutrigenetic analyses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma In the U.S, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in adults with >60,000 cases newly diagnosed each year. A few studies have identified some components of energy-balance: diet, exercise and obesity that are associated with NHL risk. Laboratory data show that these factors also can affect immune and inflammatory processes that may influence lymphomagenesis. Genetic susceptibility for NHL and NHL subtypes has been identified in biologically plausible pathways including immune function, inflammation, oxidative processes and in DNA repair and integrity. However, no comprehensive analyses have been conducted that integrate energy-balance factors, genetics and NHL risk. Our innovative analyses will leverage epidemiologic and genetic data already collected during in-person interviews in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) analyze diet, anthropometric and exercise data to determine associations with risk of NHL and NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) analyze gene-environment interactions to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in dietary response and metabolism genes, and in inflammation and immune function genes modify the association between factors in Aim 1 and NHL risk. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding and effect modification will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk and to explore differential effects by subgroups including NHL subtypes. Energy-adjusted methods and statistical methods to assess misreporting of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data also will be used for analyses of nutrient data. The studys major strengths are: 1) a rich epidemiologic dataset that includes already collected exercise, anthropometrics and dietary history data collected using a validated and calibrated FFQ with frequency and portion size for specific foods, supplement use, cooking methods and macro and micronutrients computed using a relational food composition database; 2) demographic and other data available to evaluate confounding and effect modification and; 3) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the nutrigenetics of NHL. Results from the comprehensive analyses within our large well-defined study population will provide insight into modifiable dietary-related risk factors and nutrigenetics associated with NHL and common NHL subtypes that can help clarify the role of bioactive foods in lymphomagenesis. The information from our work also will be useful to help generate hypotheses for future research, to direct functional studies, to help identify key biologic pathways that alter susceptibility, and will be directly applicable to prevention and intervention programs to reduce NHL incidence. In addition, future pooled analyses of these and related data are planned within the InterLymph Consortium to confirm findings and to increase power and sample size for analyses by rare NHL subtypes, and for low-frequency exposures that cannot be investigated adequately in individual studies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"A prospective analysis of peripheral blood cytokines and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises a heterogeneous group of >30 lymphoid neoplasms, >85% of which are of B cell lineage. NHL presents a considerable public health burden with >80,500 new diagnoses and 24,600 deaths expected in 2010. The etiology of NHL is poorly understood, but it is known that overt immune compromise is a strong risk factor. Immune dysregulation may also be important in the etiology of NHL in persons with no overt immune deficiency. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is detected in a sizeable minority of NHL in immune competent persons, but neither the true prevalence nor risk factors for EBV+ NHL are known. Th17, Th1, and Th2 cytokines mediate human immune responses and may be associated with NHL risk by virtue of their roles in B and T lymphocyte activation and inflammation. The Th17 response leads to the induction of several B cell stimulatory cytokines; this axis is also implicated in autoimmune disease, and persons with autoimmune conditions have an increased risk of NHL. It is plausible that Th17 dysregulation, and/or dysregulation of Th1 or Th2 or inflammatory responses, is associated with NHL risk in apparently immune competent adults. Cytokines also mediate host control of EBV and thus may also predict risk of EBV+ NHL. To examine these hypotheses, we will conduct prospective studies nested within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts. In a projected pooled sample of 670 cases and 1340 matched controls, we will measure a panel of immune markers in pre-diagnostic plasma samples. We will collect tissue specimens from NHL cases for pathologic studies to determine WHO-defined histologic subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) molecular subtype, and EBV status. We will use conditional logistic regression to assess the association of plasma immune markers indicative of altered Th17, Th1, Th2 and/or inflammatory responses with NHL. We will evaluate confounding by other NHL risk factors and conduct secondary analyses to examine effect modification and explore the correlation of plasma immune markers with those other factors. With these studies we will be the first to examine the etiologic role of the Th17 response in NHL, to report population-based prevalences of EBV+ NHL by subtype and of DLBCL subtypes, and to prospectively evaluate risk factors for EBV+ NHL. The multidisciplinary study team features epidemiologists (Drs. Birmann, Laden, and Giovannucci), a senior biostatistician (Dr. Rosner), and immunologists (Drs. Martmnez-Maza and Breen) and hematopathologists (Drs. Aster and Rodig) with substantial relevant experience-i.e, in the use of plasma immune markers in etiologic studies, prospective data analysis, and the pathologic determination of NHL histologic type and tumor EBV status. With this highly qualified team, the extraordinary resources of the cohorts, and the proposed studies, we are uniquely situated to contribute novel insights on the role of immune dysregulation in the etiology of NHL and EBV+ NHL in immunocompetent adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the 6th most common cancer diagnosis in the US and is sometimes associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The studies proposed in this application involve testing blood samples for levels of cytokines, which are hormones that drive immune responses, to evaluate whether risk of different types of NHL or EBV-associated NHL is related to cytokine imbalances in apparently healthy persons. The findings may be useful for identifying people at a higher risk for these cancers, the causes of which remain poorly understood.             Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the 6th most common cancer diagnosis in the US and is sometimes associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.

"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.             Relevance Statement  This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and  associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".              The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life.

"Project START: Screening to Augment Referral to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse is associated with high costs to individuals and to society but less than one- third of individuals who are drug dependent and 6% of those who abuse drugs ever receives treatment. Screening, a brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT) for substance abuse and deployed in a primary care setting has therapeutic potential but clinicians typically have less than 10 minutes with a patient and must address a range of medical problems. SBIRT, delivered by computer or nurse, would be a strong addition to a primary care clinician's therapeutic armamentarium for substance abusers but these interventions need to be tested against usual care. Women, who have lower rates of substance abuse treatment, typically receive primary medical care in a reproductive health setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal screening to determine if women abuse substances but, other than for alcohol and tobacco, there are no empirical data to support the effectiveness of this approach. In fact, the astonishing lack of data on SBIRT in primary care setting is noted by the US Preventative Services Task Force, in a 2008 report. We propose a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that would compare two SBIRTs, offered either by computer or a trained nurse, to usual care (a control condition). We will recruit 660 women with a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, opiates, prescription drugs) and randomize them to a nurse- administered referral based upon motivation principles, a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice. All subjects will receive a pamphlet with information and resources. Random effects and logistic regression models will be used to estimate group differences in primary drug used, treatment initiation, and treatment attendance among the 3 groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Random effects models will also be used to test the incremental costs of the computer and nurse administered referrals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users. We propose a pragmatic trial that would randomize 660 women in a reproductive health setting who have a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) problems to a nurse-administered referral based upon motivation principles, or a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice (control condition).

"Prescription Psychotherapeutic Drug Use Among Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence (not taking drug as prescribed dose) is a significant public health concern. Older adults are frequently prescribed psychotherapeutic drugs including opioids (pain relievers) and central nervous system (CNS) depressants (tranquilizers and sedatives). Older adults are particularly susceptible to adverse medical outcomes from prescription drug abuse, as well as drug interactions due to age-related physiologic changes in body composition and drug metabolism. Negative consequences are even more adverse when older adults abuse more than one type of psychotherapeutic drug or simultaneously use psychotherapeutic drugs and alcohol. However, little is known about risk factors for prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence and the combined use of prescription drug and alcohol. In addition, few screening tools related to drug abuse have been validated in this population. Findings of this study will lead to clinical recommendations for early identification of older adults who may be at risk for psychotherapeutic drugs non-adherence or abuse, relevant to the missions of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The purpose of this study is to describe different patterns of adherence to prescription psychotherapeutic drugs and determine the risk factors of non-adherence among older adults. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) examine the psychometric properties of the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measuring prescription drug adherence among older adults; (2) to describe patterns of adherence to prescription psychotherapeutic drug and combined use of psychotherapeutic drug and alcohol among older adults; and (3) identify risk factors of psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults. This ongoing study is a cross-sectional design. Eligibility criteria include older adults who are 65 or older, taking at least one type of prescription psychotherapeutic drug, and able to communicate. One hundred and fifty participants will be recruited for this study. Participants will be recruited from the outpatient clinics at the VA Western New York Health System (VAWHYHS), Buffalo VA, senior centers, and senior apartments. Instruments include demographic questionnaire, Timeline Followback (TLFB) measuring medication adherence and alcohol use, Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 (DAST-10), Medication Adherence Scale (MAS), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Perceived Health Status (SF-12), and Belief of Medication Questionnaire (BMQ). Descriptive and correlational statistics will be used for data analysis. Logistic regression will be performed to identify significant predictors of prescription drug non-adherence. This pilot study seeks to gain new insight regarding prescription drug non-adherence and the combined use of prescription drugs and alcohol, as well as contributing factors of non-adherence in older adults. This project initiates a program of research that will ultimately lead to the development of interventions for monitoring prescription drug adherence among older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults is a growing public health concern. Understanding how older adults adhere to these addictive medications will provide clinicians useful information to better identify older adults who may be at risk for harm related to their non-adherence to prescription drug regimens. Clinicians need to routinely screen medication-taking behaviors among older adults who are prescribed psychotherapeutic drug in order to practice prevention and early intervention.           Project Narrative Prescription psychotherapeutic drug non-adherence among older adults is a growing public health concern.

"Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral research with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients is high priority. The etiology of HNSCC is linked to the health risk behaviors of tobacco and alcohol consumption. At diagnosis, prevalence rates for cigarette smoking and alcohol use have been estimated to be above 80% and 65%, respectively. Among patients who report cigarette smoking in the year preceding diagnosis, about one-third continue to smoke following completion of cancer treatment. So while HNSCC diagnosis may be considered a ""teachable moment,"" in which motivation for health behavior change is theorized to be high, not all patients regard HNSCC diagnosis as a sufficient catalyst for cigarette smoking cessation. Notably, this is despite the fact that continued cigarette smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poorer treatment response and higher risk for recurrence. Researchers have made attempts to identify variables associated with cigarette smoking after HNSCC diagnosis, but the current literature is limited. The overall objective of the proposed project is to increase understanding of factors facilitating and impeding smoking cessation among patients recently diagnosed with HNSCC. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the trajectory of cigarette smoking from the time of HNSCC diagnosis to 6 months following initiation of cancer treatment, (2) To assess the utility of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking, and (3) To assess the independent contribution of depressive symptoms and concurrent alcohol use for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking. The above aims will be achieved using a prospective, longitudinal design in which 120 HNSCC patients are assessed before treatment initiation and then 2 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Males and females will be included in the study and the demographic characteristics of participants are expected to reflect the population of Kentucky. At each assessment, data will be collected via telephone interview. Study hypotheses will be tested using McNemar tests of paired comparisons, binomial logistic regression, and linear multiple regression analyses. Study results have the potential to highlight the importance of integrating discussions of behavior change into the course of cancer treatment, and may inform health personnel and behavioral science researchers of significant risk factors for cigarette smoking following HNSCC diagnosis. Results of the project may also be helpful in developing more efficacious smoking cessation interventions for HNSCC patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall, the proposed research is important because of its emphasis on understanding factors related to the reduction health risk behaviors, and associated improvement in clinical outcomes.           n/a",Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,7940859,F31CA139956,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Female', 'Future', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Paired Comparison', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Planning Theory', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'behavior change', 'cancer therapy', 'catalyst', 'cigarette smoking', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,F31,2010,39783,158262644,-0.03126878925143586
"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in women: reproductive, hormonal and genetic factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in women: reproductive, hormonal and genetic factors Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in U.S. adults and has a higher incidence in men than in women (ratio of 1.4:1). Although several studies have investigated the association between reproductive factors and exogenous sex-hormone exposures to explain this sex differential, results have been varied and no comprehensive assessment of relevant epidemiologic and genetic factors related to risk of NHL and NHL subtypes has been conducted. Our innovative analyses will leverage NCI funding by using epidemiologic and genetic data already collected in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) determine whether endogenous and exogenous hormone exposures in women are associated with risk of NHL and common NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to steroidogenesis or that function in the same immune- related biologic pathways as sex-hormones, alter the association between factors in Aim 1 and risk of NHL and NHL subtypes. SNPs in sex-hormone genes of interest include estrogen receptors (ESR), cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and in immune/inflammatory pathways include interleukins (IL), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-:B), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-1) and lymphotoxin alpha (LTA). Risk of NHL also has been associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and some autoimmune conditions with each in turn associated with levels and circulation of sex- hormones. Therefore, BMI and autoimmune conditions will be carefully assessed as potential confounders and effect modifiers of the association between hormonal effects and NHL risk. Parsimonious multivariable unconditional logistic regression models will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk. Gene- environment interactions will be evaluated for exposures and SNPs in genes that function in the same biologic pathways, e.g. pregnancy-related factors, and SNPs in IL-10, TNF-1, ESR1 and ESR2. False discovery rate methods will be used to control for multiple hypothesis testing. The study's major strengths are: 1) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the association between sex-hormone s and NHL susceptibility; 2) already collected rich epidemiologic dataset including extensive reproductive history, sex-steroid hormone use, autoimmune conditions and BMI available to evaluate main effects, confounding and effect modification; 5) pathological confirmation and NHL subtype classification using the WHO classification; 6) data will be pooled for future analyses within the InterLymph Consortium allowing analyses of rare subtypes and exposure. Clarifying the role of these sex-hormone related factors in NHL risk will improve our understanding of lymphomagenesis, generate hypotheses for future research and be directly applicable to screening and prevention programs to reduce NHL incidence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is higher in men than in women and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions. Given that sex-hormones impact immune function, it is plausible that hormonal-related exposures and conditions that differ between women and men may help explain the observed sex-difference in NHL. Analyses that clarify the association among reproductive factors, use of estrogen-related therapies and risk of NHL and NHL subtypes in women and whether the relationship between NHL risk and sex-related hormones is altered by variation in genes important in hormone metabolism/production and immune function will improve our understanding of NHL development, help to generate new hypotheses for future research and will be directly applicable to prevention, intervention and screening programs with a goal to reduce NHL incidence.           Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is higher in men than in women and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions.

"Energy balance and nutrigenetic analysis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Energy balance and nutrigenetic analyses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma In the U.S, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in adults with >60,000 cases newly diagnosed each year. A few studies have identified some components of energy-balance: diet, exercise and obesity that are associated with NHL risk. Laboratory data show that these factors also can affect immune and inflammatory processes that may influence lymphomagenesis. Genetic susceptibility for NHL and NHL subtypes has been identified in biologically plausible pathways including immune function, inflammation, oxidative processes and in DNA repair and integrity. However, no comprehensive analyses have been conducted that integrate energy-balance factors, genetics and NHL risk. Our innovative analyses will leverage epidemiologic and genetic data already collected during in-person interviews in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) analyze diet, anthropometric and exercise data to determine associations with risk of NHL and NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) analyze gene-environment interactions to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in dietary response and metabolism genes, and in inflammation and immune function genes modify the association between factors in Aim 1 and NHL risk. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding and effect modification will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk and to explore differential effects by subgroups including NHL subtypes. Energy-adjusted methods and statistical methods to assess misreporting of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data also will be used for analyses of nutrient data. The studys major strengths are: 1) a rich epidemiologic dataset that includes already collected exercise, anthropometrics and dietary history data collected using a validated and calibrated FFQ with frequency and portion size for specific foods, supplement use, cooking methods and macro and micronutrients computed using a relational food composition database; 2) demographic and other data available to evaluate confounding and effect modification and; 3) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the nutrigenetics of NHL. Results from the comprehensive analyses within our large well-defined study population will provide insight into modifiable dietary-related risk factors and nutrigenetics associated with NHL and common NHL subtypes that can help clarify the role of bioactive foods in lymphomagenesis. The information from our work also will be useful to help generate hypotheses for future research, to direct functional studies, to help identify key biologic pathways that alter susceptibility, and will be directly applicable to prevention and intervention programs to reduce NHL incidence. In addition, future pooled analyses of these and related data are planned within the InterLymph Consortium to confirm findings and to increase power and sample size for analyses by rare NHL subtypes, and for low-frequency exposures that cannot be investigated adequately in individual studies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions. There is growing evidence that the modifiable lifestyle factors of diet, physical activity and obesity are associated with NHL risk and that these factors act in genetic pathways that also have been associated with NHL risk. Clarifying the role that these modifiable factors play in risk of NHL and NHL subtypes will improve our understanding of NHL development, help to generate new hypotheses for future research and will be directly applicable to prevention, intervention and screening programs with a goal to reduce NHL incidence.          Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and  few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some  rare genetic conditions.

"Help Seeking Behavior in College Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem with health implications is intimate partner violence (IPV). College women are at greater risk for intimate partner violence, rape and other forms of sexual assault, usually in dating experiences, than women in the general population or in a comparable age group 1, 2. Despite campus prevention and intervention programs, the majority of college women do not report their DV to campus or local authorities and many do not seek needed health care or mental health services 3, 4. Limited research explores help seeking behavior, defined as any behavior that one uses to solve a problem, in college women, especially related to violence 5. The purpose of this project is to determine the significant attitudes and beliefs that are associated with reporting of dating violence in college women. Achieving this goal will guide future research developing and testing effective prevention and intervention strategies to facilitate and increase reporting of dating violence in this population. The proposed study uses an exploratory design, guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), to test the relationship of attitudes and beliefs with the help seeking behavior of reporting dating violence and to describe dating violence help seeking behavior of college women. Specific aims and hypotheses are as follows. Aim 1) to determine significant attitudes and beliefs associated with the help seeking behavior of reporting DV Hypothesis 1) it is expected that a positive relationship of moderate strength will exist between intention to report and a) positive normative beliefs about help seeking, b) lower perceived barriers to help seeking, c) increased cognitive beliefs about DV. Aim 2) to identify the significant attitudes and beliefs that differentiate between individuals with intention to report violence and those who do not intend to report violence. Hypothesis 2) individuals who intend to report DV will be more likely to have increased mental health symptoms of somatization, anxiety depression and general psychological distress and lower levels of social support than individuals who are not likely to report violence. Aim 3) to identify the significant attitudes and beliefs that differentiate between victims with intention to report violence and those who do not intend to report violence. Hypothesis 3) victims who intend to report DV will be more likely to have experienced significantly higher levels of violence, increased mental health symptoms of somatization, anxiety depression and general psychological distress and lower levels of social support than victims who are not likely to report violence; Aim 4) to describe the formal and informal help seeking behavior of victims of dating violence. A nonprobability purposive sample of 2500 college women will be recruited for an electronic survey. Hypotheses will be tested, using logistic regression. Determining significant attitudes and beliefs that predict DV help seeking is necessary to develop interventions that are clinically meaningful and theoretically driven.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Violence against women is a significant public health and societal issue. Experiencing DV is associated with immediate and long term physical and mental health consequences. Many victims do not disclose their experience or seek healthcare or mental health counseling. When violence is undetected and treatment is not provided, the health consequences increase. Past experiences of violence predict future experiences of violence. Limited research explores dating violence help seeking of college women. The proposed project seeks to enhance primary and secondary prevention by providing theoretically driven and clinically relevant intervention strategies. The proposed study offers a conceptual base to understand the attitudes and beliefs associated with reporting and disclosing intimate partner violence and the influence of friends and peers. The knowledge gained from this theory-driven study will aid in the planning of an intervention program to target specific attitudes and beliefs in order to increase reporting and disclosing intimate partner violence. Health professionals will use the findings to enhance the screening and surveillance procedures for identifying individuals who have experienced intimate partner violence. It is clear from the literature that college students experience IPV and experience health consequences. Therefore, it is important to determine ways to increase identification of victims so that services can be provided.           Relevance to Public Health Violence against women is a significant public health and societal issue.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.

"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.              Relevance Statement This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults.

"Project START: Screening to Augment Referral to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse is associated with high costs to individuals and to society but less than one- third of individuals who are drug dependent and 6% of those who abuse drugs ever receives treatment. Screening, a brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT) for substance abuse and deployed in a primary care setting has therapeutic potential but clinicians typically have less than 10 minutes with a patient and must address a range of medical problems. SBIRT, delivered by computer or nurse, would be a strong addition to a primary care clinician's therapeutic armamentarium for substance abusers but these interventions need to be tested against usual care. Women, who have lower rates of substance abuse treatment, typically receive primary medical care in a reproductive health setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal screening to determine if women abuse substances but, other than for alcohol and tobacco, there are no empirical data to support the effectiveness of this approach. In fact, the astonishing lack of data on SBIRT in primary care setting is noted by the US Preventative Services Task Force, in a 2008 report. We propose a controlled, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that would compare two SBIRTs, offered either by computer or a trained nurse, to usual care (a control condition). We will recruit 660 women with a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, opiates, prescription drugs) and randomize them to a nurse- administered referral based upon motivation principles, a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice. All subjects will receive a pamphlet with information and resources. Random effects and logistic regression models will be used to estimate group differences in primary drug used, treatment initiation, and treatment attendance among the 3 groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Random effects models will also be used to test the incremental costs of the computer and nurse administered referrals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users. We propose a pragmatic trial that would randomize 660 women in a reproductive health setting who have a range of psychoactive substance use (e.g. tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) problems to a nurse-administered referral based upon motivation principles, or a computer referral based upon motivation principles or brief advice (control condition). Costs of the conditions would be estimated to provide models of cost effectiveness.           Project START Narrative Screening, brief interventions and referral to treatment for substance abuse have therapeutic potential but are understudied in primary care settings, in women and drug users.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".              The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral research with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients is high priority. The etiology of HNSCC is linked to the health risk behaviors of tobacco and alcohol consumption. At diagnosis, prevalence rates for cigarette smoking and alcohol use have been estimated to be above 80% and 65%, respectively. Among patients who report cigarette smoking in the year preceding diagnosis, about one-third continue to smoke following completion of cancer treatment. So while HNSCC diagnosis may be considered a ""teachable moment,"" in which motivation for health behavior change is theorized to be high, not all patients regard HNSCC diagnosis as a sufficient catalyst for cigarette smoking cessation. Notably, this is despite the fact that continued cigarette smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poorer treatment response and higher risk for recurrence. Researchers have made attempts to identify variables associated with cigarette smoking after HNSCC diagnosis, but the current literature is limited. The overall objective of the proposed project is to increase understanding of factors facilitating and impeding smoking cessation among patients recently diagnosed with HNSCC. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the trajectory of cigarette smoking from the time of HNSCC diagnosis to 6 months following initiation of cancer treatment, (2) To assess the utility of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking, and (3) To assess the independent contribution of depressive symptoms and concurrent alcohol use for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking. The above aims will be achieved using a prospective, longitudinal design in which 120 HNSCC patients are assessed before treatment initiation and then 2 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Males and females will be included in the study and the demographic characteristics of participants are expected to reflect the population of Kentucky. At each assessment, data will be collected via telephone interview. Study hypotheses will be tested using McNemar tests of paired comparisons, binomial logistic regression, and linear multiple regression analyses. Study results have the potential to highlight the importance of integrating discussions of behavior change into the course of cancer treatment, and may inform health personnel and behavioral science researchers of significant risk factors for cigarette smoking following HNSCC diagnosis. Results of the project may also be helpful in developing more efficacious smoking cessation interventions for HNSCC patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall, the proposed research is important because of its emphasis on understanding factors related to the reduction health risk behaviors, and associated improvement in clinical outcomes.           n/a",Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,7679187,F31CA139956,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Female', 'Future', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Paired Comparison', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Planning Theory', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'behavior change', 'cancer therapy', 'catalyst', 'cigarette smoking', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,F31,2009,38329,158262644,-0.03126878925143586
"Help Seeking Behavior in College Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem with health implications is intimate partner violence (IPV). College women are at greater risk for intimate partner violence, rape and other forms of sexual assault, usually in dating experiences, than women in the general population or in a comparable age group 1, 2. Despite campus prevention and intervention programs, the majority of college women do not report their DV to campus or local authorities and many do not seek needed health care or mental health services 3, 4. Limited research explores help seeking behavior, defined as any behavior that one uses to solve a problem, in college women, especially related to violence 5. The purpose of this project is to determine the significant attitudes and beliefs that are associated with reporting of dating violence in college women. Achieving this goal will guide future research developing and testing effective prevention and intervention strategies to facilitate and increase reporting of dating violence in this population. The proposed study uses an exploratory design, guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), to test the relationship of attitudes and beliefs with the help seeking behavior of reporting dating violence and to describe dating violence help seeking behavior of college women. Specific aims and hypotheses are as follows. Aim 1) to determine significant attitudes and beliefs associated with the help seeking behavior of reporting DV Hypothesis 1) it is expected that a positive relationship of moderate strength will exist between intention to report and a) positive normative beliefs about help seeking, b) lower perceived barriers to help seeking, c) increased cognitive beliefs about DV. Aim 2) to identify the significant attitudes and beliefs that differentiate between individuals with intention to report violence and those who do not intend to report violence. Hypothesis 2) individuals who intend to report DV will be more likely to have increased mental health symptoms of somatization, anxiety depression and general psychological distress and lower levels of social support than individuals who are not likely to report violence. Aim 3) to identify the significant attitudes and beliefs that differentiate between victims with intention to report violence and those who do not intend to report violence. Hypothesis 3) victims who intend to report DV will be more likely to have experienced significantly higher levels of violence, increased mental health symptoms of somatization, anxiety depression and general psychological distress and lower levels of social support than victims who are not likely to report violence; Aim 4) to describe the formal and informal help seeking behavior of victims of dating violence. A nonprobability purposive sample of 2500 college women will be recruited for an electronic survey. Hypotheses will be tested, using logistic regression. Determining significant attitudes and beliefs that predict DV help seeking is necessary to develop interventions that are clinically meaningful and theoretically driven.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Violence against women is a significant public health and societal issue. Experiencing DV is associated with immediate and long term physical and mental health consequences. Many victims do not disclose their experience or seek healthcare or mental health counseling. When violence is undetected and treatment is not provided, the health consequences increase. Past experiences of violence predict future experiences of violence. Limited research explores dating violence help seeking of college women. The proposed project seeks to enhance primary and secondary prevention by providing theoretically driven and clinically relevant intervention strategies. The proposed study offers a conceptual base to understand the attitudes and beliefs associated with reporting and disclosing intimate partner violence and the influence of friends and peers. The knowledge gained from this theory-driven study will aid in the planning of an intervention program to target specific attitudes and beliefs in order to increase reporting and disclosing intimate partner violence. Health professionals will use the findings to enhance the screening and surveillance procedures for identifying individuals who have experienced intimate partner violence. It is clear from the literature that college students experience IPV and experience health consequences. Therefore, it is important to determine ways to increase identification of victims so that services can be provided.           Relevance to Public Health Violence against women is a significant public health and societal issue.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  About 10% of women who are unable to get pregnant are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). DOR describes a reduction in ovarian function. Few women (<5%) with this diagnosis will become pregnant spontaneously and they do not respond normally to fertility drugs. There are no effective treatments to reverse this condition. Women with DOR may have a premutation alteration of the Fragile X gene (""carriers""). Carriers of this premutation are also at increased risk for premature ovarian failure (POF), which is a greater degree of ovarian dysfunction than DOR. About 5-6% of the women with POF are premutation carriers (14% if she has a family history of premature menopause; 2% otherwise). It is unknown what percentage of women with DOR are premutation carriers. We will extend the current Fragile X research on POF to the DOR population. Specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the prevalence of the Fragile X premutation among DOR women; (2) to determine if the prevalence varies with a family history of early menopause and/or infertility; and (3) to determine if there is a relationship between patient age, follicle stimulating hormone level, and the ""size"" of the premutation. In this prospective cohort, 65 eligible DOR patients will be enrolled from three academic medical centers (Virginia, North Carolina) and one private practice. The protocol includes pretest genetic counseling, a blood sample for Fragile X testing, and questionnaires. No blood test results will be filed in the medical charts, and women will have the option of learning their Fragile X test results or not. Post test genetic counseling will be provided to all carriers. We are currently pilot-testing this study; among our first 16 participants, one is a carrier and 15 have wanted to learn their test results. The statistical analysis will consist of proportions with binomial testing, logistic regression models, and linear regression models. This research may identify a new phenotype from Fragile X premutations, begin the development of a clinical tool to predict age-at-infertility among carriers, and enhance reproductive planning and decision-making by carriers. The implications of fertility treatment to Fragile X carriers is notable in terms of transmitting Fragile X Syndrome to the children born via fertility treatment; therefore, this research also has applications to the greater issue of the impact on society and individuals from unanticipated genetic testing.          n/a",Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve,7393354,R03HD052768,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Condition', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'FMR1 Gene', 'Failure', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Female infertility', 'Fertility', 'Fertility Agents', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Premutation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Menopause', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovary', 'Participant', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premature Menopause', 'Premature Ovarian Failure', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Degree Relative', 'Societies', 'Son', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virginia', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'improved', 'prospective', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'reproductive', 'size', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R03,2008,78645,169622494,0.030425068652178307
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome.

"Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this Developmental Grant Proposal for Collaborative International Projects are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) using a nurse-delivered motivational intervention, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS + 6) in the emergency room (ER) in Sosnowiec, Poland; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine SBIRT study to a non-academic ER setting outside of the U.S. The SBIRT study, recently funded by NIAAA and SAMHSA, is the first multisite, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER. We will conduct a blinded randomized brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and noninjured patients over the aged of 18 will be screened for at-risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Those screening positive will be asked to participate in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and brief intervention, with n=292 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months.      Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk taking disposition and readiness and stage of change. Prior research in the ER in Sosnowiec and a pilot feasibility study of SBIRT in Sosnowiec suggest: 1) a large number of ""at risk"", heavy problem and dependent drinkers who meet screening criteria for brief intervention in a relatively short period of time; 2) a socialized health care system which provides equal access to care and is not subject to selection bias affecting patient access; 3) a patient sample covering a large geographic area; 4) a stable environment facilitating high follow-up rates post-intervention; and, 5) a well integrated referral system and high accessibility to alcohol treatment services. Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. The ER is an important setting for screening and brief intervention for those with alcohol-related problems in order to reduce subsequent alcohol-related ER visits and associated costs and increase quality of life. This project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes.          n/a",Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland,7371147,R21AA016081,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Cities', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human Resources', 'Impulsivity', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Poland', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Visit', 'Week', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'day', 'drinking', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'injured', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'motivational intervention', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'social', 'trauma centers', 'willingness']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2008,166229,20386554,-0.026494984659590496
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,7274714,R21AT002520,"['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Acupuncture procedure', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Androgens', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Infertility', 'Insulin', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Measures', 'Menstrual cycle', 'OGTT', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovulation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prolactin', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin', 'Simulate', 'Smoking Status', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Syndrome', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virginia', 'Week', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'follow-up', 'interest', 'reproductive', 'reproductive hormone', 'treatment duration']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R21,2007,148916,169622494,0.0371107566145847
"Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this Developmental Grant Proposal for Collaborative International Projects are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) using a nurse-delivered motivational intervention, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS + 6) in the emergency room (ER) in Sosnowiec, Poland; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine SBIRT study to a non-academic ER setting outside of the U.S. The SBIRT study, recently funded by NIAAA and SAMHSA, is the first multisite, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER. We will conduct a blinded randomized brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and noninjured patients over the aged of 18 will be screened for at-risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Those screening positive will be asked to participate in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and brief intervention, with n=292 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months.      Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk taking disposition and readiness and stage of change. Prior research in the ER in Sosnowiec and a pilot feasibility study of SBIRT in Sosnowiec suggest: 1) a large number of ""at risk"", heavy problem and dependent drinkers who meet screening criteria for brief intervention in a relatively short period of time; 2) a socialized health care system which provides equal access to care and is not subject to selection bias affecting patient access; 3) a patient sample covering a large geographic area; 4) a stable environment facilitating high follow-up rates post-intervention; and, 5) a well integrated referral system and high accessibility to alcohol treatment services. Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. The ER is an important setting for screening and brief intervention for those with alcohol-related problems in order to reduce subsequent alcohol-related ER visits and associated costs and increase quality of life. This project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes.          n/a",Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland,7209884,R21AA016081,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Cities', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human Resources', 'Impulsivity', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Poland', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Visit', 'Week', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'day', 'drinking', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'injured', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'motivational intervention', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'social', 'trauma centers', 'willingness']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2007,182784,20386554,-0.026494984659590496
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,7153491,R01HD046595,"['Acetaminophen', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Amoxicillin', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dietary intake', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Gastroschisis', 'General Population', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Ibuprofen', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Limb structure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mothers', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'North America', 'Nurses', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vitamins', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'improved', 'malformation', 'metropolitan', 'oral cleft', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'reproductive']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2007,264692,164685352,0.009991621484963461
"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression. The likelihood ratio test will be used to discriminate between nested models. Statistical power calculations produced for the specific aims show that our study is adequately sized.         n/a",Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma,7227781,R01CA111720,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Biological Assay', 'Build-it', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cervical Adenocarcinoma', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cohort Studies', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Human papillomavirus 16', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Invasive', 'Investigation', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Oncogenic', 'Pap smear', 'Papillomavirus', 'Participant', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Registers', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Specimen', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'leukocyte antigen typing', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'size', 'viral DNA']",NCI,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R01,2007,395107,1346985,0.007769435506251747
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program-DOVE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children witnessing the intimate partner violence (IPV) of their mothers are known to have sedous long-term physical and mental health and behavioral consequences. While almost half of these children were less than 6 years old, little is known about appropriate interventions for very young children and their abused mothers. Building on the demonstrated positive effects of early home visitation models of providing care, this study proposes to incorporate routine screening for IPV and a structured IPV intervention into existing home visitation (HV) programs for young families expecting a child. Traditional home visitation and Olds model of home visitation programs will be examined using a two-group quasi experimental design with nurses randomized to provide a structured IPV intervention to pregnant/postpartum women or to provide standard care or usual care to women who disclose IPV. Home visitors (nurses and trained lay visitors) in each home visitation program will be randomized to the intervention or a comparison condition. There will be four groups of 60 families from an urban (2 groups) and rural (2 groups) home visitation settings. Mothers and infants plus one child less than 6 years (if there is one) in all families will be monitored at birth, 3 months, 6 months and then at 6-month intervals through 24 months. Maternal dependent measures include IPV, level of danger, and safety strategies as well as depression, parenting stress, high risk parenting, attachment, and perceived adaptability of the child (PSI). The infant plus one-index sibling dependent measures are physical and mental development (Bailey Infant Neurodevelopmental Screening) as well as physical and mental health problems. The study will provide intervention efficacy data as well as prospective information about patterns of IPV, maternal health, and infant and child development in homes where there is IPV.

"Longitudinal Psychometric Investigation of the WISDM Tobacco Dependence Measure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Description: The construct of nicotine dependence (ND) is assumed to underlie tobacco addiction but there is a notable lack of consensus about the nature and optimal measurement of ND. In applied research, ND is often assumed to be a dimensional, trait-like condition with varying degrees of severity although some studies use categorical or discrete diagnostic conceptualizations of ND as found in the DSM-IV diagnosis of Nicotine Dependence. There is increasing evidence that ND is multidimensional. Only recently have psychometrically sound, theoretically-based, multidimensional measures of ND been developed, such as the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM). The WISDM measures thirteen smoking dependence motives that are hypothesized to influence dependence processes such as inability to quit, nicotine withdrawal, and relapse. The WISDM subscales reflect a variety of theory-based internal factors (e.g., tolerance) and external factors (e.g., social and environmental goads to smoke) that permit investigation of different smoking motives in clinical and experimental contexts. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the nature of ND by assessing measurement and structural invariance across gender and racial/ethnic groups and time as well as investigating the predictive, concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity of WISDM subscales. This will be accomplished by conducting a series of secondary analyses on datasets from two observational studies and two smoking cessation clinical trials that administered the WISDM to culturally diverse smokers (White, African American, and Hispanic). Latent variable (e.g., multigroup confirmatory factor analyses) and other models will test for invariance of key model parameters (e.g., factor covariances) across gender and racial/ethnic groups as a means of evaluating similarity of multidimensional models across the groups. Validity analyses will include multivariate linear and logistic regression models as well as latent variable modeling that will allow complex tests of individual WISDM dimensions or sets of dimensions in relation to smoking and relapse. Observed measures such as cigarettes smoked per day, latency between first cigarette and regular use of cigarettes, and end-of- treatment cessation success will be related to WISDM measures in these validity analyses. The goal of all of these analyses is to characterize dimensions that represent core features of ND that influence smoking behavior as well as cessation and relapse. Lay Description: This study will investigate how various theoretical dimensions of nicotine dependence, as measured by the 13-factor Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives, relate to one another and to important smoking- and cessation-related outcomes and whether these relations are consistent across gender and racial/ethnic groups.           n/a",Longitudinal Psychometric Investigation of the WISDM Tobacco Dependence Measure,7226812,R03CA126406,"['clinical research', 'ethnic group', 'measurement', 'model', 'nicotine', 'psychometrics', 'sex', 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R03,2006,76953,0,0.011101687855813194
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM.

"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,7140060,R21AT002520,"['acupuncture /acupressure', 'alternative medicine', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'female', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'hormone regulation /control mechanism', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'luteinizing hormone', 'ovulation', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R21,2006,201729,0,0.0371107566145847
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,6979792,R01HD046595,"['acetaminophen', 'aspirin', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'congenital cardiovascular disorder', 'congenital nervous system disorder', 'congenital reproductive system disorder', 'congenital skeletal disorder', 'embryo /fetus drug adverse effect', 'gestational age', 'human data', 'human pregnant subject', 'ibuprofen', 'penicillins', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy disorder chemotherapy', 'self medication', 'statistics /biometry', 'teratogens']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2006,272621,164685352,0.009991621484963461
"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,7053359,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,316973,77336088,0.026808818258587094
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.

"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression. The likelihood ratio test will be used to discriminate between nested models. Statistical power calculations produced for the specific aims show that our study is adequately sized.         n/a",Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma,7060445,R01CA111720,"['MHC class II antigen', 'Scandinavian', 'Scandinavian country', 'adenocarcinoma', 'cancer risk', 'cervical /vaginal smear', 'cervix neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'female', 'genetic registry /resource /referral center', 'genetic susceptibility', 'histopathology', 'human papillomavirus', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'longitudinal human study', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'technology /technique development', 'virus DNA', 'virus load', 'virus related neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R01,2006,416252,1346985,0.007769435506251747
"Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program-DOVE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children witnessing the intimate partner violence (IPV) of their mothers are known to have sedous long-term physical and mental health and behavioral consequences. While almost half of these children were less than 6 years old, little is known about appropriate interventions for very young children and their abused mothers. Building on the demonstrated positive effects of early home visitation models of providing care, this study proposes to incorporate routine screening for IPV and a structured IPV intervention into existing home visitation (HV) programs for young families expecting a child. Traditional home visitation and Olds model of home visitation programs will be examined using a two-group quasi experimental design with nurses randomized to provide a structured IPV intervention to pregnant/postpartum women or to provide standard care or usual care to women who disclose IPV. Home visitors (nurses and trained lay visitors) in each home visitation program will be randomized to the intervention or a comparison condition. There will be four groups of 60 families from an urban (2 groups) and rural (2 groups) home visitation settings. Mothers and infants plus one child less than 6 years (if there is one) in all families will be monitored at birth, 3 months, 6 months and then at 6-month intervals through 24 months. Maternal dependent measures include IPV, level of danger, and safety strategies as well as depression, parenting stress, high risk parenting, attachment, and perceived adaptability of the child (PSI). The infant plus one-index sibling dependent measures are physical and mental development (Bailey Infant Neurodevelopmental Screening) as well as physical and mental health problems. The study will provide intervention efficacy data as well as prospective information about patterns of IPV, maternal health, and infant and child development in homes where there is IPV. Analyses will include mixed linear models, ANCOVA and MANOVA procedures and logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE).            n/a",Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program-DOVE,7030650,R01NR009093,"['behavior therapy', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'child mental health service', 'child physical development', 'child psychology', 'child rearing', 'clinical research', 'community mental health services', 'domestic violence', 'health services research tag', 'home health care', 'human pregnant subject', 'human subject', 'infant human (0-1 year)', 'mother child interaction', 'nursing intervention', 'nursing research', 'outcomes research', 'patient oriented research', 'postpartum depression', 'preschool child (1-5)', 'rural area', 'socioenvironment', 'urban area', 'violence prevention', 'women&apos', 's health']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,667934,807432003,0.005203035587783717
"Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The benefits of mammography screening in women age 80 and older are uncertain. Guidelines encourage physicians to consider life expectancy before screening elderly women and to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their elderly patients. Despite these recommendations, many elderly women are screened even those in poor health. It is unknown why so many elderly women are choosing to be screened and what factors influence this decision. To determine the accuracy of elderly women's knowledge about screening mammography and factors that influence screening decisions, the applicant proposes a two-phase study. Phase 1 uses qualitative methods to develop a survey about mammography screening decisions in the elderly and phase 2 involves administering the survey to a larger sample of women age 80 and older, using women ages 50-69 as a comparison group. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression will be performed to compare the accuracy of screening knowledge between elderly and younger patients as well as to determine age differences in the influence of several factors on the decision to be screened. This is the first study to explore very elderly women's approach to decisions about screening mammography. n/a",Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly,7107006,F32CA110424,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'decision making', 'female', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'interview', 'mammography', 'perception', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'preference', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2005,1913,135941803,0.009237882423900641
"Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The incidence of human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the US has nearly doubled over the previous 30 years. Epidemiologic research has evaluated a variety of factors potentially associated with risk of NHL but results have been inconsistent and cannot explain the dramatic increase in incidence. Several epidemiologic studies in humans have suggested that exposure to household environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), lawn care herbicides, and pesticides such as those contained in flea control products may plausibly increase risk of NHL, but these relationships have not been well evaluated. Epidemiologic studies of companion animals offer a complementary means by which to identify risk factors for cancers of relevance to both animals and humans. Because canine malignant lymphoma (CML) has been established as a model for NHL and domestic dogs share their living environment with their human owners, a study of environmental exposures and CML provides a unique opportunity to evaluate factors that may potentially relate to NHL. The proposed case-control study will use hospital records to identify cases of CML and 2 control groups of dogs, one consisting of dogs with benign tumors and one consisting of dog with non-cancer chronic diseases, seen at the Foster Hospital at Tufts University between 2000 and 2005. Owners of CML cases and controls will be sent a questionnaire to assess household ETS, use of flea control products, lawn care herbicides and other factors prior to diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression will then be used to evaluate the relationship between environmental exposures and risk of CML. In addition, because the methods used in epidemiologic studies of companion animals are not well established, the proposed project will also include a validation study of ETS exposure measurement, and evaluate if owner characteristics are associated with likelihood of returning a mailed questionnaire. Owners of 1000 dogs presenting to Foster Hospital over a two-month period will be asked to complete a questionnaire measuring demographic and environmental factors, and to provide a urine sample from their dog. Urine samples from approximately 130 dogs will be assayed for level of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine well established as a biologic marker for ETS exposure, and cotinine levels will be compared with level of household smoking reported by questionnaire. One year later, a second questionnaire will be mailed to all participants, and characteristics of respondent and non-respondent owners will be compared. Any differences will then be taken into consideration in the calculation of relative risks using a novel form of sensitivity analysis to produce more accurate estimates of the association between environmental exposures and risk of CML. Because dogs and their human owners share a common environment within the household, results from this study will have direct relevance to the on-going effort to identify factors that may increase risk of human NHL. n/a",Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma,6931858,R03CA103513,"['cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'dogs', 'environmental exposure', 'herbicides', 'human subject', 'lymphoma', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'nicotine', 'nonHodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'passive smoking', 'pesticide biological effect', 'pesticide residues', 'pesticides', 'questionnaires', 'veterinary medicine']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R03,2005,76639,35034877,0.020967572538713408
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,6943947,R01NR008434,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'cost effectiveness', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'nursing research', 'patient oriented research', 'telemedicine', 'therapy compliance']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2005,100000,232986943,-0.0004991044008947445
"Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program (NC-BCSP) has conducted a ten-year effectiveness trial of a natural helper lay health advisor intervention in 10 counties (5 interventions, 5 comparisons) in eastern North Carolina to increase mammography use by low-income, rural, African American women. Three waves (baseline and 2 follow-ups) of interview data collected from a stratified random sample of, initially, 1000 Black women (500 intervention, 500 comparison) indicate that NC-BCSP's lay health advisor intervention was modestly effective overall after 30 months (at first follow-up IT2] in 1997), and associated with a greater increase in recent mammography use among specific subgroups, particularly women with annual family incomes under $12,000.  The proposed exploratory study uses all three waves of cohort data to determine: 1) whether NC-BCSP's intervention effect was sustained over the full 8 years of the evaluation (T1-T3), and for which subgroups; 2) what factors are associated with, and what pathways mediated, the intervention's effect initially (T1 - T2,) and in the second follow-up period (T2-T3); 3) how successfully an existing administrative data set (Medicare) can be used, instead of self-report data, to evaluate intervention effectiveness; and 4) whether geographical proximity, as measured by GIS software, of lay advisors to cohort respondents can serve as a useful proxy for self-report measures of exposure to the lay advisors. Analyses will use multivariate models with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mammography reports.  The proposed secondary analyses of this unique longitudinal data set will provide valuable insights for designing more effective, better targeted, and more cost-effective interventions to reach the hardest-to-reach rural women still not being screened regularly. The goal of this grant is to understand the differences between continuous users, backsliders, late adopters and non-users of screening mammography, and the mechanisms, which explain variation in these groups' exposure to the intervention and their use, or non-use, of mammography. n/a",Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation,6917000,R21CA098934,"['African American', 'Medicare /Medicaid', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'early diagnosis', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health behavior', 'health care referral /consultation', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'longitudinal human study', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mammography', 'medically underserved population', 'physicians', 'rural area', 'social support network']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2005,131400,0,-0.00151539291848593
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6927154,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'communication', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional ability', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'outcomes research', 'pain', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'questionnaires', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2005,150000,0,0.025206817063848953
"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,6970579,R21AT002520,"['acupuncture /acupressure', 'alternative medicine', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'female', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'hormone regulation /control mechanism', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'luteinizing hormone', 'ovulation', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R21,2005,206584,0,0.0371107566145847
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,6867958,R01HD046595,"['acetaminophen', 'aspirin', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'congenital cardiovascular disorder', 'congenital nervous system disorder', 'congenital reproductive system disorder', 'congenital skeletal disorder', 'embryo /fetus drug adverse effect', 'gestational age', 'human data', 'human pregnant subject', 'ibuprofen', 'penicillins', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy disorder chemotherapy', 'self medication', 'statistics /biometry', 'teratogens']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2005,279306,164685352,0.009991621484963461
"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers. ANCOVA will be applied to      control confounding factors.                                                                                                                                              n/a",Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia,6885777,R01NR005002,"['antioxidants', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'clinical trials', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'erythrocytes', 'exercise', 'female', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'lipid peroxides', 'low density lipoprotein', 'oxidative stress', 'patient oriented research', 'preeclampsia', 'superoxide dismutase', 'vascular endothelium', 'women&apos', 's health']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2005,319243,641965656,0.01322284218005526
"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,6919155,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,321788,77336088,0.026808818258587094
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression. The likelihood ratio test will be used to discriminate between nested models. Statistical power calculations produced for the specific aims show that our study is adequately sized.         n/a",Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma,6855636,R01CA111720,"['MHC class II antigen', 'Scandinavian', 'Scandinavian country', 'adenocarcinoma', 'cancer risk', 'cervical /vaginal smear', 'cervix neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'female', 'genetic registry /resource /referral center', 'genetic susceptibility', 'histopathology', 'human papillomavirus', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'longitudinal human study', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'technology /technique development', 'virus DNA', 'virus load', 'virus related neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R01,2005,423791,1346985,0.007769435506251747
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community Comorbidity of mental and medical illness is a major problem compromising the health of a significant number of Americans.  Comorbid medical and mental illnesses are far more prevalent than previously thought and have a negative impact greater than the sum of either illness alone.  Failure to appreciate the presence of comorbidity when researching the predictors or consequences of either illness alone can significantly compromise not only diagnosis and treatment of the affected patient but the impact of both illnesses on the health of the public overall.  In the proposed study we capitalize on the availability of a long term, carefully selected longitudinal community cohort of 2500 white and African American (36 percent) men (25 percent) and women in mid to later life (45 year and older) who are participating in an ongoing study on the epidemiology of osteoarthritis.  Drawing on two previous waves of data collected from this cohort in 1995-1999 and 1999-2002, we propose re-interviewing these 2500 individuals at two additional points of time over the next 5 years (between 2001-2005).  Our proposed interviews will include the administration of a well established standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview which will allow us to identify people in this community who do and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders.  We also will explore several psychometric issues and controversies related to the measurement of psychological and psychiatric distress.  Finally, we use a theoretically-informed conceptual framework to identify risk-producing and protective factors for psychiatric comorbidity and test hypotheses about their mechanisms of action and consequences for health and well being.

"Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The benefits of mammography screening in women age 80 and older are uncertain. Guidelines encourage physicians to consider life expectancy before screening elderly women and to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their elderly patients. Despite these recommendations, many elderly women are screened even those in poor health. It is unknown why so many elderly women are choosing to be screened and what factors influence this decision. To determine the accuracy of elderly women's knowledge about screening mammography and factors that influence screening decisions, the applicant proposes a two-phase study. Phase 1 uses qualitative methods to develop a survey about mammography screening decisions in the elderly and phase 2 involves administering the survey to a larger sample of women age 80 and older, using women ages 50-69 as a comparison group. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression will be performed to compare the accuracy of screening knowledge between elderly and younger patients as well as to determine age differences in the influence of several factors on the decision to be screened.

"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6796148,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', 'antihistamines', 'biomarker', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis inhibitor', 'chemokine', 'clinical research', 'cytokine receptors', 'genetic polymorphism', 'glioma', 'human data', 'human genetic material tag', 'human tissue', 'hypersensitivity', 'interleukin 13', 'interleukin 4', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'neoplasm /cancer immunology', 'nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2004,68103,241268189,-0.006442046839178666
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6725468,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Trichomonas vaginalis', 'adolescence (12-20)', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'female', 'gonorrhea', 'human subject', 'interview', 'reproductive system infection', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'sign /symptom', 'urinalysis', 'urinary tract infection', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2004,74500,0,0.007164270414137339
"Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The incidence of human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the US has nearly doubled over the previous 30 years. Epidemiologic research has evaluated a variety of factors potentially associated with risk of NHL but results have been inconsistent and cannot explain the dramatic increase in incidence. Several epidemiologic studies in humans have suggested that exposure to household environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), lawn care herbicides, and pesticides such as those contained in flea control products may plausibly increase risk of NHL, but these relationships have not been well evaluated. Epidemiologic studies of companion animals offer a complementary means by which to identify risk factors for cancers of relevance to both animals and humans. Because canine malignant lymphoma (CML) has been established as a model for NHL and domestic dogs share their living environment with their human owners, a study of environmental exposures and CML provides a unique opportunity to evaluate factors that may potentially relate to NHL. The proposed case-control study will use hospital records to identify cases of CML and 2 control groups of dogs, one consisting of dogs with benign tumors and one consisting of dog with non-cancer chronic diseases, seen at the Foster Hospital at Tufts University between 2000 and 2005. Owners of CML cases and controls will be sent a questionnaire to assess household ETS, use of flea control products, lawn care herbicides and other factors prior to diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression will then be used to evaluate the relationship between environmental exposures and risk of CML. In addition, because the methods used in epidemiologic studies of companion animals are not well established, the proposed project will also include a validation study of ETS exposure measurement, and evaluate if owner characteristics are associated with likelihood of returning a mailed questionnaire. Owners of 1000 dogs presenting to Foster Hospital over a two-month period will be asked to complete a questionnaire measuring demographic and environmental factors, and to provide a urine sample from their dog. Urine samples from approximately 130 dogs will be assayed for level of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine well established as a biologic marker for ETS exposure, and cotinine levels will be compared with level of household smoking reported by questionnaire. One year later, a second questionnaire will be mailed to all participants, and characteristics of respondent and non-respondent owners will be compared. Any differences will then be taken into consideration in the calculation of relative risks using a novel form of sensitivity analysis to produce more accurate estimates of the association between environmental exposures and risk of CML. Because dogs and their human owners share a common environment within the household, results from this study will have direct relevance to the on-going effort to identify factors that may increase risk of human NHL. n/a",Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma,6795262,R03CA103513,"['cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'dogs', 'environmental exposure', 'herbicides', 'human subject', 'lymphoma', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'nicotine', 'nonHodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'passive smoking', 'pesticide biological effect', 'pesticide residues', 'pesticides', 'questionnaires', 'veterinary medicine']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R03,2004,76639,35034877,0.020967572538713408
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,6825152,R01NR008434,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'cost effectiveness', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'nursing research', 'patient oriented research', 'telemedicine', 'therapy compliance']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2004,100000,232986943,-0.0004991044008947445
"Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program (NC-BCSP) has conducted a ten-year effectiveness trial of a natural helper lay health advisor intervention in 10 counties (5 interventions, 5 comparisons) in eastern North Carolina to increase mammography use by low-income, rural, African American women. Three waves (baseline and 2 follow-ups) of interview data collected from a stratified random sample of, initially, 1000 Black women (500 intervention, 500 comparison) indicate that NC-BCSP's lay health advisor intervention was modestly effective overall after 30 months (at first follow-up IT2] in 1997), and associated with a greater increase in recent mammography use among specific subgroups, particularly women with annual family incomes under $12,000.  The proposed exploratory study uses all three waves of cohort data to determine: 1) whether NC-BCSP's intervention effect was sustained over the full 8 years of the evaluation (T1-T3), and for which subgroups; 2) what factors are associated with, and what pathways mediated, the intervention's effect initially (T1 - T2,) and in the second follow-up period (T2-T3); 3) how successfully an existing administrative data set (Medicare) can be used, instead of self-report data, to evaluate intervention effectiveness; and 4) whether geographical proximity, as measured by GIS software, of lay advisors to cohort respondents can serve as a useful proxy for self-report measures of exposure to the lay advisors. Analyses will use multivariate models with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mammography reports.  The proposed secondary analyses of this unique longitudinal data set will provide valuable insights for designing more effective, better targeted, and more cost-effective interventions to reach the hardest-to-reach rural women still not being screened regularly. The goal of this grant is to understand the differences between continuous users, backsliders, late adopters and non-users of screening mammography, and the mechanisms, which explain variation in these groups' exposure to the intervention and their use, or non-use, of mammography. n/a",Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation,6707741,R21CA098934,"['African American', 'Medicare /Medicaid', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'early diagnosis', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health behavior', 'health care referral /consultation', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'longitudinal human study', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mammography', 'medically underserved population', 'physicians', 'rural area', 'social support network']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2004,131400,0,-0.00151539291848593
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,7142772,R01HD038856,"['African American', 'bacterial disease', 'caucasian American', 'cervical /vaginal smear', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'drug detection', 'gestational age', 'human pregnant subject', 'interview', 'mass screening', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnancy', 'spontaneous abortion', 'statistics /biometry', 'telecommunications', 'urinalysis', 'vaginitis', 'women&apos', 's health']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,138339,0,0.027590180907351717
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6789322,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'communication', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional ability', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'outcomes research', 'pain', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'questionnaires', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2004,150000,0,0.025206817063848953

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers.

"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,6826654,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,308691,77336088,0.026808818258587094
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals. An effective, low-cost expert system that can reduce the prevalence of depression on a population basis has significant commercial potential.  n/a",An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care,6708400,R44MH060522,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cognitive behavior therapy', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted patient care', 'depression', 'health behavior', 'health care model', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mass screening', 'medical outreach /case finding', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'outcomes research', 'patient oriented research', 'primary care physician']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2004,354507,846010,0.020456297592157842
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community Comorbidity of mental and medical illness is a major problem compromising the health of a significant number of Americans.  Comorbid medical and mental illnesses are far more prevalent than previously thought and have a negative impact greater than the sum of either illness alone.  Failure to appreciate the presence of comorbidity when researching the predictors or consequences of either illness alone can significantly compromise not only diagnosis and treatment of the affected patient but the impact of both illnesses on the health of the public overall.  In the proposed study we capitalize on the availability of a long term, carefully selected longitudinal community cohort of 2500 white and African American (36 percent) men (25 percent) and women in mid to later life (45 year and older) who are participating in an ongoing study on the epidemiology of osteoarthritis.  Drawing on two previous waves of data collected from this cohort in 1995-1999 and 1999-2002, we propose re-interviewing these 2500 individuals at two additional points of time over the next 5 years (between 2001-2005).  Our proposed interviews will include the administration of a well established standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview which will allow us to identify people in this community who do and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders.  We also will explore several psychometric issues and controversies related to the measurement of psychological and psychiatric distress.  Finally, we use a theoretically-informed conceptual framework to identify risk-producing and protective factors for psychiatric comorbidity and test hypotheses about their mechanisms of action and consequences for health and well being. Data analysis approaches will include multiple logistic regression - dichotomous or polytomous, as appropriate, logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and models based on Item Response Theory.  n/a",Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community,6794747,R01MH064034,"['anxiety', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'depression', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental health epidemiology', 'osteoarthritis', 'person with disability', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'rural area']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2004,700941,0,0.01601553177053519
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient.

"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6694204,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', ' antihistamines', ' biomarker', ' cancer risk', ' carcinogenesis inhibitor', ' chemokine', ' clinical research', ' cytokine receptors', ' genetic polymorphism', ' glioma', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' human tissue', ' hypersensitivity', ' interleukin 13', ' interleukin 4', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplasm /cancer immunology', ' nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,73750,241268189,-0.006442046839178666
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6600325,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Trichomonas vaginalis', ' adolescence (12-20)', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' female', ' gonorrhea', ' human subject', ' interview', ' reproductive system infection', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' sign /symptom', ' urinalysis', ' urinary tract infection', "" women's health""]",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2003,74500,0,0.007164270414137339
"JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS This proposal responds to research topic 12 (Cognition in Context), with secondary relevance to topic 19 (Genetics, Behavior and Aging). The aging of the U.S. population has stimulated public health interest in identifying factors that can preserve the cognitive functioning of older adults. Complex work may be one activity that has a salutary effect on late-life cognitive function, but factors like intelligence, educational level, and early environmental exposures are potential confounds to this association. Twin studies allow for control of many of these confounding factors. The goal of this project is to determine whether occupational complexity is associated with better late-life cognitive functioning in a sample of elderly twins, using data collected by the Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging on members of the National Research Council-National Academy of Sciences (NAS-NRC) Registry of World War II veteran twins. Specific Aim 1 of this project is to classify each twin's primary lifetime occupation using the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), from which a measure of complexity can be derived. This allows additional Specific Aims (SA) to be tested using co-twin control analyses: (SA 2) estimate the association between occupational complexity and cognitive status, (SA 3) estimate the association between occupational complexity and change in cognitive status over time, and (SA 4) estimate the extent to which intelligence moderates the relationship between occupational complexity and cognitive status. The study sample, which comprises approximately 1000 monozygotic and 1000 dizygotic twin pairs, has been administered a cognitive status examination every 3-4 years since 1990 as part of a screening and assessment protocol for dementia. Approximately 300 of these pairs also have scores on standard armed services intelligence tests. Logistic regression dependent on twin pair will be used to estimate association between a factor-based measure of occupational complexity from the DOT and either baseline (SA 2) or change scores (SA 3) from the cognitive status measure. Analyses for SA 4 will be similar, using the intelligence test score as a covariate. If occupational complexity is found to enhance late-life cognitive functioning, this modifiable factor could inform cognitive interventions and influence decisions about occupational activities and retirement. Follow-up twin studies can explore whether complex work is a protective factor for dementia. n/a",JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS,6684283,R03AG022683,"['aging', ' clinical research', ' cognition', ' human data', ' human old age (65+)', ' intelligence tests', ' occupations', ' twin /multiplet', ' veterans']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,77000,607172798,-0.0059515455336955105
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention. Only have of the women initially assigned to receive the interactive computer program or video will receive the booster in order to compare the women receiving the booster intervention with women who receive only the initial intervention.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal. The research plan will produce a data set of adequate scope and size to allow Dr. Nichols to apply the epidemiologic and biostatistical theory learned in the classroom. Throughout the course of the training plan, Dr. Nichols will complete the Ph.D. program in Vision Science/Physiological Optics and the Master's in Public Health program with an emphasis in epidemiology and biostatistics at The Ohio State University. Together, the research plan and the training plan will provide Dr. Nichols with the skills and experience needed to excel as a patient-based clinician-scientist.  n/a",FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,6628632,K23EY000393,"['clinical research', ' environmental stressor', ' epidemiology', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' female', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human subject', ' interview', ' keratoconjunctivitis sicca', ' longitudinal human study', ' physiologic stressor', ' postmenopause', ' questionnaires', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2003,125465,241268189,0.003718700199578519

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II).

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6650183,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2003,368323,111231681,0.02477878318247759
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.

Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.

"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders. TLC-M users in both studies will be queried regarding their             satisfaction with TLC-M.                                                                                                                                                  n/a",AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY,6603279,R01CA084447,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' counseling', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' telecommunications', "" women's health""]",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2003,428953,61416950,0.025659534372632027
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals.

"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6637934,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2003,611480,593605914,0.027590180907351717
"Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community Comorbidity of mental and medical illness is a major problem compromising the health of a significant number of Americans.  Comorbid medical and mental illnesses are far more prevalent than previously thought and have a negative impact greater than the sum of either illness alone.  Failure to appreciate the presence of comorbidity when researching the predictors or consequences of either illness alone can significantly compromise not only diagnosis and treatment of the affected patient but the impact of both illnesses on the health of the public overall.  In the proposed study we capitalize on the availability of a long term, carefully selected longitudinal community cohort of 2500 white and African American (36 percent) men (25 percent) and women in mid to later life (45 year and older) who are participating in an ongoing study on the epidemiology of osteoarthritis.  Drawing on two previous waves of data collected from this cohort in 1995-1999 and 1999-2002, we propose re-interviewing these 2500 individuals at two additional points of time over the next 5 years (between 2001-2005).  Our proposed interviews will include the administration of a well established standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview which will allow us to identify people in this community who do and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders.  We also will explore several psychometric issues and controversies related to the measurement of psychological and psychiatric distress.  Finally, we use a theoretically-informed conceptual framework to identify risk-producing and protective factors for psychiatric comorbidity and test hypotheses about their mechanisms of action and consequences for health and well being. Data analysis approaches will include multiple logistic regression - dichotomous or polytomous, as appropriate, logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and models based on Item Response Theory.  n/a",Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community,6654357,R01MH064034,"['anxiety', ' clinical research', ' comorbidity', ' depression', ' functional ability', ' human subject', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' mental health epidemiology', ' osteoarthritis', ' person with disability', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' rural area']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,681363,0,0.01601553177053519

"Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression Relatively little work has explored the role of stress and social rhythms (i.e., daily routines) as they impact the circadian system in depression. The goal of this project is to investigate a theoretical model describing pathways by which social factors may be related to depression via their impact on circadian rhythms. After meeting screening criteria, 40 depressed and 40 normal control participants will complete a life events interview.  They will be given actillumes (devices which measure sleep/wake activity) and prospective, daily measures of social interactions and mood to complete over a 1-week period of time.  For both groups, linear regression will be used to predict social and circadian rhythms from social rhythm disruption (SRD) life events that have occurred within the past 4 months.  Cross-sectional analyses utilizing linear and logistic regression will investigate the relationship between circadian and social rhythms and circadian rhythms and depression.  It is predicted that individuals with depression are more sensitive and less adaptive to changes in their environment as compared to non-depressed subjects.  This project will increase our understanding of psychosocial and biological interactions involved in major depressive disorder.  In addition, this study is likely to enhance understanding of the validity of social rhythms as a construct.

"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal. The research plan will produce a data set of adequate scope and size to allow Dr. Nichols to apply the epidemiologic and biostatistical theory learned in the classroom. Throughout the course of the training plan, Dr. Nichols will complete the Ph.D. program in Vision Science/Physiological Optics and the Master's in Public Health program with an emphasis in epidemiology and biostatistics at The Ohio State University. Together, the research plan and the training plan will provide Dr. Nichols with the skills and experience needed to excel as a patient-based clinician-scientist.  n/a",FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,6498296,K23EY000393,"['clinical research', ' environmental stressor', ' epidemiology', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' female', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human subject', ' interview', ' keratoconjunctivitis sicca', ' longitudinal human study', ' physiologic stressor', ' postmenopause', ' questionnaires', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2002,122598,241268189,0.003718700199578519
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6547472,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' communication', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' drug screening /evaluation', ' functional ability', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' pain', ' patient care personnel relations', ' physicians', ' questionnaires', ' rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2002,150000,0,0.025206817063848953
"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers. ANCOVA will be applied to      control confounding factors.                                                                                                                                              n/a",Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia,6539394,R01NR005002,"['antioxidants', ' cardiovascular disorder therapy', ' clinical trials', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' erythrocytes', ' exercise', ' female', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' lipid peroxides', ' low density lipoprotein', ' oxidative stress', ' patient oriented research', ' preeclampsia', ' superoxide dismutase', ' vascular endothelium', "" women's health""]",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2002,307772,641965656,0.01322284218005526
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention. Only have of the women initially assigned to receive the interactive computer program or video will receive the booster in order to compare the women receiving the booster intervention with women who receive only the initial intervention.  Baseline interviews prior to intervention) will take place in the multi service center and telephone interviews will take place a three times following intervention delivery. l. Women will receive $25.00 following each interview, for a total of $100. This study is developed to have 90% power to detect overall differences in compliance at six months and 21 months.  Mammography compliance will be measured through self-report and facility verification.  Belief variables built into the intervention and measured through validity and reliability.

"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN Numerous case reports have demonstrated lead poisoning with potentially fatal consequences can result from retained lead projectiles following firearm injuries.  To assess the impact of retained projectiles on subsequent lead exposure, one cannot rely on self-selected cases presenting with symptoms of lead intoxication.  The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the morbidity associated with body lead burden as a result of retained bullets from firearm injuries.  The proposed investigation seeks to identify risk factors of elevated blood lead levels for individuals with retained lead bullets, establish appropriate protocols for lead testing, develop indications for bullet removal and provide guidelines for the appropriate management of fragments not removed. The study design included follow-up of 300 patients with retained lead bullets/bullet fragments presenting for acute care of firearm injury at large publicly owned Level 1 Trauma Center.  A baseline blood level is measured as soon after patient stabilization as possible and repeated at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.  Medical history regarding prior firearms injuries and other retained projectiles is taken, along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other sources of lead (occupational/recreational) to which the patient might have been or at present be exposed.  The patient will have K- shell X ray florescence determination of bone lead in the tibia and calcaneus in order to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnairer.  Multivariate models of blood level are made for each patient visit using risk factor and bone lead concentration data.  Determinations will be made if changes in blood lead, adjusted for risk factors and bone lead concentration, from one 3 month period to the next can be significantly predicted by the coded location and fragmentation data of projectiles and presence or absence of fractures.  The variables of location, fragmentation, fracture and total time during which the projectile was retained in the body will be tested using logistic regression.  This will determine odds ratios of elevated lead at various concentrations (greater than 15 mug/dL, greater than 25  mug/dL, greater than 40 mug/dL, etc.) due to these factors.  Data will also be analyzed in the framework of the general linear model (GML), with a repeated measure design.  Principal interest will be in increasing trend of blood level as a function of fragmentation location, fracture and duration variables.  n/a",THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN,6525222,R01ES010166,"['X ray', ' blood chemistry', ' clinical research', ' environmental exposure', ' foreign body reaction', ' human morbidity', ' human subject', ' injury', ' lead', ' lead poisoning', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' questionnaires', ' radiofluorescent probe', ' statistics /biometry']",NIEHS,CHARLES R.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6523755,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2002,395840,111231681,0.02477878318247759
"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders. TLC-M users in both studies will be queried regarding their             satisfaction with TLC-M.                                                                                                                                                  n/a",AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY,6514314,R01CA084447,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' counseling', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' telecommunications', "" women's health""]",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2002,405159,61416950,0.025659534372632027
"STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-modal Well Woman intervention to prevent new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among young, low-income African American women with a history of repeated STDs.  The target group lives on or near the Chicago Westside, where women are plagued with some of the highest STD rates in the nation. The Specific Aim is to determine the effects of the randomized, controlled repeated measures trial on (a) the mediating outcomes--STD related social, psychological, and skill/behavioral factors, and (b) the health status outcome-laboratory-confirmed newly contracted STDs.  The intervention is case-managed by advanced practice nurses (APNs) and complemented by a social worker and peer educators.  The intervention has a 2 month intensive phase and a 10-month maintenance phase with evidence- based standardized and individualized STD-prevention strategies: STD diagnosis, treatment, teaching, and support by APNs; STD prevention classes led by peer educators; community referrals and retention strategies by a social worker; and partner classes, counseling, and referrals.  Subjects will be 670 women aged 18-29 years who have an index STD and at least 1 other STD in their histories.  Subject recruitment will occur at 4 publicly supported West Side clinics, and the intervention will be in the West Side Health Center, a new Cook County Health Services facility in the center of the area.  After baseline measures, the women will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups with the minimization subject distribution procedure, taking into account the history of intravenous drug use, number of sexual partners, sexual violence, and HIV seropositivity.  The control group will have usual care, STD urine screening, HIV testing (offered) and a minimal didactic experience until the 12-month measure is taken.  Then they will be offered a concentrated intervention.  A STD-Prevention Framework derived from a tested nursing model, Cox's Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior, will guide the overall intervention and the components.  Analyses include change scores, logistic regression, proportional odds regression and random regression analysis.  n/a",STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,6539375,R01NR004836,"['AIDS /HIV test', ' African American', ' HIV infections', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' communicable disease control', ' counseling', ' female', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' low socioeconomic status', ' nursing intervention', ' sex behavior', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' substance abuse related behavior', "" women's health"", ' young adult human (21-34)']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2002,467931,148463823,-0.03154628024100446
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6536122,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2002,611300,593605914,0.027590180907351717
"Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community Comorbidity of mental and medical illness is a major problem compromising the health of a significant number of Americans.  Comorbid medical and mental illnesses are far more prevalent than previously thought and have a negative impact greater than the sum of either illness alone.  Failure to appreciate the presence of comorbidity when researching the predictors or consequences of either illness alone can significantly compromise not only diagnosis and treatment of the affected patient but the impact of both illnesses on the health of the public overall.  In the proposed study we capitalize on the availability of a long term, carefully selected longitudinal community cohort of 2500 white and African American (36 percent) men (25 percent) and women in mid to later life (45 year and older) who are participating in an ongoing study on the epidemiology of osteoarthritis.  Drawing on two previous waves of data collected from this cohort in 1995-1999 and 1999-2002, we propose re-interviewing these 2500 individuals at two additional points of time over the next 5 years (between 2001-2005).  Our proposed interviews will include the administration of a well established standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview which will allow us to identify people in this community who do and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders.  We also will explore several psychometric issues and controversies related to the measurement of psychological and psychiatric distress.  Finally, we use a theoretically-informed conceptual framework to identify risk-producing and protective factors for psychiatric comorbidity and test hypotheses about their mechanisms of action and consequences for health and well being. Data analysis approaches will include multiple logistic regression - dichotomous or polytomous, as appropriate, logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and models based on Item Response Theory.  n/a",Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community,6529310,R01MH064034,"['anxiety', ' clinical research', ' comorbidity', ' depression', ' functional ability', ' human subject', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' mental health epidemiology', ' osteoarthritis', ' person with disability', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' rural area']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2002,678788,0,0.01601553177053519
"Latinas:  Impact of Citizenship on Access to Pap Smears Some studies have found Latina women to be a particularly vulnerable population as regards underutilization of preventive services (Anderson and May, 1995, Kirkman-Liff and Kronenfeld, 1992). Given the importance of preventive services, including cancer-screening services to reduce morbidity and mortality, it is important to identify predictors of this under-utilization of services. Barriers specific to immigrant women have been investigated including issues of acculturation, language, and country of origin. However, one factor that has not been explored is the impact of citizenship status. The Expanded Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use is a highly regarded model for explaining health care services utilization. To date, citizenship status has not been included in this model. Citizenship may increase the predictive ability of this model and should be considered for inclusion. The purpose of this research is to test, through applied research, the appropriateness of including a citizenship variable in the Andersen paradigm. This research is designed to examine utilization of preventive services by Latina women living in Los Angeles County with the intent of determining whether citizenship plays a significant role in access, especially for the large Latina immigrant population. Access/ utilization will be measured by appropriate use of the specific cancer-screening test for cancer of the cervix, the Pap smear. A cross-sectional study design using a secondary data source will examine the impact of citizenship on a sample of 1784 Latina women, ages 18 years or older, living in Los Angeles County. The data are from the 1997 Los Angeles County Health Survey which is a population-based, random digit dialing telephone survey of 8,004 households in Los Angeles County. Logistic regression will be performed separately for each of the empirical models. Stepwise regression will facilitate variables being added (forced in) according to the expansion of the initial, simple model. This modeling methodology allows for analysis of changes in the results as the conceptual model is expanded to include additional predictors of Pap smear utilization. The final model will control for approximately 40+ separate factors derived from the Andersen Model that might impact on access/utilization of this preventive service.  n/a",Latinas:  Impact of Citizenship on Access to Pap Smears,6315032,R03HS011273,"['Hispanic Americans', ' United States', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' female', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' immigrant', ' interview', ' named group']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2001,32048,673201228,-0.00974009530401486
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal. The research plan will produce a data set of adequate scope and size to allow Dr. Nichols to apply the epidemiologic and biostatistical theory learned in the classroom. Throughout the course of the training plan, Dr. Nichols will complete the Ph.D. program in Vision Science/Physiological Optics and the Master's in Public Health program with an emphasis in epidemiology and biostatistics at The Ohio State University. Together, the research plan and the training plan will provide Dr. Nichols with the skills and experience needed to excel as a patient-based clinician-scientist.  n/a",FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,6261256,K23EY000393,"['clinical research', ' environmental stressor', ' epidemiology', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' female', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human subject', ' interview', ' keratoconjunctivitis sicca', ' longitudinal human study', ' physiologic stressor', ' postmenopause', ' questionnaires', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2001,119812,241268189,0.003718700199578519
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals. An effective, low-cost expert system that can reduce the prevalence of depression on a population basis has significant commercial potential.  n/a",An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care,6404326,R44MH060522,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' cognitive behavior therapy', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted patient care', ' depression', ' health behavior', ' health care model', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' mass screening', ' medical outreach /case finding', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' patient oriented research', ' primary care physician']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2001,150886,846010,0.020456297592157842
"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6372233,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,181196,607172798,-0.010197758805933028
"PRENATAL MENTAL HEALTH OF POOR WOMEN--SERVICES AND COSTS The primary purpose of this study is to determine the impact of prenatal         psychiatric disorders on birth outcomes, health service utilization and          costs.  Infant mortality and morbidity rates in this country continue            to exceed those of most industrialized countries.  For low-income women,         particularly African Americans and those with limited access to health           services, infant mortality and morbidity rates approximate those of              third-world countries.  Although biological, genetic and psychosocial            factors are linked to poor birth outcomes, one factor that has been              overlooked is prenatal psychiatric disorders, despite compelling                 evidence associating mental health problems with maternal-infant health.         Even less is known about how our health service delivery system                  contributes to poor birth outcomes through inadequate detection and              treatment of prenatal psychiatric disorders.  A better understanding of          how psychiatric illness influences the prenatal and postpartum use of            health services and costs is also needed.  This study will use a                 prospective cohort research design to compare outcomes between low-              income pregnant women with and without psychiatric disorders who are             stratified by race and urban-rural residence.  Using the Composite               International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the presence or absence of            current psychiatric disorders will first be determined in a sample of            1095 pregnant Medicaid recipients who receive services in Special                Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).           A sample of 219 pregnant women with current psychiatric diagnoses and            a comparison group of 211 pregnant women without psychiatric diagnoses           will be followed for three months postpartum to ascertain birth                  outcomes, use of health services and cost of these services.  Using              Birth certificate and Medicaid claims data, multiple or logistic                 regression will determine the independent effect of current psychiatric          disorders on birth outcomes and health service utilization rates,                controlling for other explanatory variables.

"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.  Random regression analyses will be used to estimate the effects of meeting criteria for TG on suicidality, and degree of impaired health and functioning.  Results will provide a validated diagnostic algorithm for TG derived from proposed consensus criteria, and psychometrically sound and clinically useful assessment tools for this disorder.   At-risk  individuals and potentially important foci for lay (social integration) and psychotherapeutic (e.g., treatment of attachment disturbances) intervention will be identified, as will the mental and physical health impairments associated with meeting diagnostic criteria for TG.  n/a","TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES",6392197,R01MH056529,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bereavement', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' functional ability', ' human morbidity', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' psychometrics', ' psychosocial separation', ' sign /symptom', ' social integration', ' statistics /biometry', ' suicide', ' widowhood']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,242499,550947887,0.01286027693759765
"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes.

"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention. Only have of the women initially assigned to receive the interactive computer program or video will receive the booster in order to compare the women receiving the booster intervention with women who receive only the initial intervention.  Baseline interviews prior to intervention) will take place in the multi service center and telephone interviews will take place a three times following intervention delivery. l. Women will receive $25.00 following each interview, for a total of $100. This study is developed to have 90% power to detect overall differences in compliance at six months and 21 months.  Mammography compliance will be measured through self-report and facility verification.  Belief variables built into the intervention and measured through validity and reliability.  The primary outcomes at six month and 21 months will be tested by a chi-square statistic using logistic regression with two degrees of freedom.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6402593,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2001,384853,111231681,0.02477878318247759
"THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN Numerous case reports have demonstrated lead poisoning with potentially fatal consequences can result from retained lead projectiles following firearm injuries.  To assess the impact of retained projectiles on subsequent lead exposure, one cannot rely on self-selected cases presenting with symptoms of lead intoxication.  The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the morbidity associated with body lead burden as a result of retained bullets from firearm injuries.  The proposed investigation seeks to identify risk factors of elevated blood lead levels for individuals with retained lead bullets, establish appropriate protocols for lead testing, develop indications for bullet removal and provide guidelines for the appropriate management of fragments not removed. The study design included follow-up of 300 patients with retained lead bullets/bullet fragments presenting for acute care of firearm injury at large publicly owned Level 1 Trauma Center.  A baseline blood level is measured as soon after patient stabilization as possible and repeated at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.  Medical history regarding prior firearms injuries and other retained projectiles is taken, along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other sources of lead (occupational/recreational) to which the patient might have been or at present be exposed.  The patient will have K- shell X ray florescence determination of bone lead in the tibia and calcaneus in order to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnairer.  Multivariate models of blood level are made for each patient visit using risk factor and bone lead concentration data.  Determinations will be made if changes in blood lead, adjusted for risk factors and bone lead concentration, from one 3 month period to the next can be significantly predicted by the coded location and fragmentation data of projectiles and presence or absence of fractures.  The variables of location, fragmentation, fracture and total time during which the projectile was retained in the body will be tested using logistic regression.  This will determine odds ratios of elevated lead at various concentrations (greater than 15 mug/dL, greater than 25  mug/dL, greater than 40 mug/dL, etc.) due to these factors.  Data will also be analyzed in the framework of the general linear model (GML), with a repeated measure design.  Principal interest will be in increasing trend of blood level as a function of fragmentation location, fracture and duration variables.  n/a",THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN,6382333,R01ES010166,"['X ray', ' blood chemistry', ' clinical research', ' environmental exposure', ' foreign body reaction', ' human morbidity', ' human subject', ' injury', ' lead', ' lead poisoning', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' questionnaires', ' radiofluorescent probe', ' statistics /biometry']",NIEHS,CHARLES R.

"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6331914,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2001,469177,593605914,0.027590180907351717
"COMMUNITY-SITE CORONARY RISK CONTROL IN BLACK FAMILIES This study tests the effectiveness of Neighborhood Health Worker/Nurse           Case Management compared with usual care (referral to usual primary care         source) for the management of coronary heart disease risk factors in             African American siblings of persons with premature coronary disease.            Index patients with documented coronary disease prior to 60 years of age         will be recruited from 7 Baltimore hospitals to identify 480 siblings            to be screened to identify those with a criterion risk factor (LDL-              cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl, blood pressure greater than 140/90           mmHg, and/or cigarette smoking) (n=433).  Eligible siblings are those            between 30 and 60 years of age with no known coronary disease.  Siblings         with criterion risk factors after screening will be randomly assigned            by family to receive care in the community by a case management team             consisting of a Neighborhood Health Worked guided by a nurse and                 cardiologist, or to receive usual care.  Siblings will be followed one           year after screening to determine the proportion in each group who meet          goal levels of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, dietary fat, physical            activity, and smoking cessation.  The study builds on prior work in both         the African American community and in siblings that shows that 1.) nurse         managed care produces more successful risk reduction, 2.) African                Americans accept care in the community and from Neighborhood Health              Workers, and 3.) sociocultural models of care are more likely to be              successful in high risk African American families.  The goal is to               increase the proportion of high risk siblings who achieve goals based            on national guidelines.

"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders. TLC-M users in both studies will be queried regarding their             satisfaction with TLC-M.                                                                                                                                                  n/a",AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY,6377708,R01CA084447,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' counseling', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' telecommunications', "" women's health""]",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2001,487782,61416950,0.025659534372632027
"Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community Comorbidity of mental and medical illness is a major problem compromising the health of a significant number of Americans.  Comorbid medical and mental illnesses are far more prevalent than previously thought and have a negative impact greater than the sum of either illness alone.  Failure to appreciate the presence of comorbidity when researching the predictors or consequences of either illness alone can significantly compromise not only diagnosis and treatment of the affected patient but the impact of both illnesses on the health of the public overall.  In the proposed study we capitalize on the availability of a long term, carefully selected longitudinal community cohort of 2500 white and African American (36 percent) men (25 percent) and women in mid to later life (45 year and older) who are participating in an ongoing study on the epidemiology of osteoarthritis.  Drawing on two previous waves of data collected from this cohort in 1995-1999 and 1999-2002, we propose re-interviewing these 2500 individuals at two additional points of time over the next 5 years (between 2001-2005).  Our proposed interviews will include the administration of a well established standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview which will allow us to identify people in this community who do and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders.  We also will explore several psychometric issues and controversies related to the measurement of psychological and psychiatric distress.  Finally, we use a theoretically-informed conceptual framework to identify risk-producing and protective factors for psychiatric comorbidity and test hypotheses about their mechanisms of action and consequences for health and well being. Data analysis approaches will include multiple logistic regression - dichotomous or polytomous, as appropriate, logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and models based on Item Response Theory.  n/a",Psychiatric and Medical CoMorbidity in a Rural Community,6364710,R01MH064034,"['anxiety', ' clinical research', ' comorbidity', ' depression', ' functional ability', ' human subject', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' mental health epidemiology', ' osteoarthritis', ' person with disability', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' rural area']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2001,609804,0,0.01601553177053519
"STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-modal Well Woman intervention to prevent new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among young, low-income African American women with a history of repeated STDs.  The target group lives on or near the Chicago Westside, where women are plagued with some of the highest STD rates in the nation. The Specific Aim is to determine the effects of the randomized, controlled repeated measures trial on (a) the mediating outcomes--STD related social, psychological, and skill/behavioral factors, and (b) the health status outcome-laboratory-confirmed newly contracted STDs.  The intervention is case-managed by advanced practice nurses (APNs) and complemented by a social worker and peer educators.  The intervention has a 2 month intensive phase and a 10-month maintenance phase with evidence- based standardized and individualized STD-prevention strategies: STD diagnosis, treatment, teaching, and support by APNs; STD prevention classes led by peer educators; community referrals and retention strategies by a social worker; and partner classes, counseling, and referrals.  Subjects will be 670 women aged 18-29 years who have an index STD and at least 1 other STD in their histories.  Subject recruitment will occur at 4 publicly supported West Side clinics, and the intervention will be in the West Side Health Center, a new Cook County Health Services facility in the center of the area.  After baseline measures, the women will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups with the minimization subject distribution procedure, taking into account the history of intravenous drug use, number of sexual partners, sexual violence, and HIV seropositivity.  The control group will have usual care, STD urine screening, HIV testing (offered) and a minimal didactic experience until the 12-month measure is taken.  Then they will be offered a concentrated intervention.  A STD-Prevention Framework derived from a tested nursing model, Cox's Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior, will guide the overall intervention and the components.

Index patients with documented coronary disease prior to 60 years of age         will be recruited from 7 Baltimore hospitals to identify 480 siblings            to be screened to identify those with a criterion risk factor (LDL-              cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl, blood pressure greater than 140/90           mmHg, and/or cigarette smoking) (n=433).  Eligible siblings are those            between 30 and 60 years of age with no known coronary disease.  Siblings         with criterion risk factors after screening will be randomly assigned            by family to receive care in the community by a case management team             consisting of a Neighborhood Health Worked guided by a nurse and                 cardiologist, or to receive usual care.  Siblings will be followed one           year after screening to determine the proportion in each group who meet          goal levels of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, dietary fat, physical            activity, and smoking cessation.  The study builds on prior work in both         the African American community and in siblings that shows that 1.) nurse         managed care produces more successful risk reduction, 2.) African                Americans accept care in the community and from Neighborhood Health              Workers, and 3.) sociocultural models of care are more likely to be              successful in high risk African American families.  The goal is to               increase the proportion of high risk siblings who achieve goals based            on national guidelines.  This is one of the first studies to empirically         examine a combination of community intervention for multiple risk factor         reduction using indigenous workers and approaches which address the              needs of individuals with a documented family history of premature               coronary heart disease.

"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE--CHINESE WOMEN IN THE US AND IN CHINA Chinese families are particularly in a vulnerable position for domestic violence due to lack of awareness and cultural background.  Few studies have looked at the prevalence and outcomes of domestic violence among the Chinese population, in the US or in China.  The specific aims of the proposed study will focus on: 1) to develop a culturally appropriate instrument for assessing domestic violence against Chinese women in the US and in China; 2) to investigate, document and compare the type and prevalence of domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and in China; 3) to investigate and compare the risk factors for domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and in China; and 4) to examine and compare the mental and physical health outcomes associated with domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and China.  For preliminary instrument development, a total sample of 200 battered Chinese women and staff working with them will be obtained from 3 Asian Women's Shelters in the US and a Women's Federation in China.  A final random sample of 2000 Chinese women will be interviewed in New York Chinatown clinical settings and 4 major hospitals in Fuzhou, China for the abuse prevalence survey. Medical records will be reviewed on at least 120 battered women identified from the prevalence survey in both countries.  The interview instrument for domestic violence screening, which will screen for prior year abuse and lifetime history of abuse and types of abuse, will be designed and tested for reliability and validity prior to the dissertation.  Descriptive statistics and odds ratios will be used to compare types and prevalence of abuse, and multiple logistic regression will be used to determine the risk factors and associated medical conditions and symptoms for cases as compared to controls.  This proposed study will build on the Sponsor's prior and current research in the area with case control studies, and the applicant's preliminary prevalence violence study in China to investigate domestic violence in Chinese population in the US and in China.  n/a",DOMESTIC VIOLENCE--CHINESE WOMEN IN THE US AND IN CHINA,6187489,F31NR007446,"['China', ' Chinese', ' Chinese American', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' culture', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' health', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mental health', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' spouse abuse', ' statistics /biometry', ' violence']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2000,28480,807432003,0.036004367380263726
"BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE RISK Several studies have shown that people born small or thin have increased risk for developing Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults.  These observations have led to the ""fetal origins"" hypothesis - that susceptibility to these chronic adult conditions may be programmed in utero.  The profound metabolic and hemodynamic changes that occur in gestation make pregnancy a physiologic stress test for glucose intolerance, hypertension, and other IRS-related abnormalities. Gestational diabetes (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) are two common complications of pregnancy that share many characteristics of IRS, and also predict a woman's risk for the later development of NIDDM and CVD.  We propose to investigate the effects of a woman's growth before her own birth (indicated by her own birthweight and gestational age) on her risk in young adulthood for PIH or GDM.  Apart from promising preliminary work we have recently completed in Colorado, this is an area of investigation that has not previously been explored.  The proposal is to conduct a case-control study based on birth registry and hospital discharge data from New York State and New York City, computer-linked across a generation.  Subjects will be women who were born in NY after 1959 and delivered a live singleton infant in New York between 1990 and 1996.  Cases will be subjects who had PIH and/or GDM diagnosed during a recent pregnancy (1990-1996), while controls will be subjects frequency matched to cases on hospital and year of delivery, but without a diagnosis of PIH or GDM.  The records of each subject's recent pregnancy (1990-1996) will be matched to those of her own birth (12-36 years earlier).  We will use multiple logistic regression to estimate the independent effects of a mother's own early growth, as indicated by birth weight and gestational age, on her later risk of developing GDM or PIH.  The analysis will account for potential confounding and effect-modifying factors, including race/ethnicity, maternal age, and smoking.  We will also conduct a sub-study of the validity of the diagnoses of GDM and PIH on the birth records.  This study will thus offer a powerful and cost-efficient way to investigate the hypothesis of the fetal origins of GDM and PIH, two common but still poorly understood complications of pregnancy which are associated with increased risk for chronic disease later in life.  n/a",BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE RISK,6177562,R03DK053608,"['age at pregnancy', ' chronic disease /disorder', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' gestational age', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human birth weight', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' pregnancy toxemia /hypertension', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' tobacco abuse']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2000,75443,292134808,-0.019690749514395797
"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6169107,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,178725,607172798,-0.010197758805933028
"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.  Random regression analyses will be used to estimate the effects of meeting criteria for TG on suicidality, and degree of impaired health and functioning.  Results will provide a validated diagnostic algorithm for TG derived from proposed consensus criteria, and psychometrically sound and clinically useful assessment tools for this disorder.   At-risk  individuals and potentially important foci for lay (social integration) and psychotherapeutic (e.g., treatment of attachment disturbances) intervention will be identified, as will the mental and physical health impairments associated with meeting diagnostic criteria for TG.  n/a","TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES",6186158,R01MH056529,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bereavement', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' functional ability', ' human morbidity', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' psychometrics', ' psychosocial separation', ' sign /symptom', ' social integration', ' statistics /biometry', ' suicide', ' widowhood']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,279963,550947887,0.01286027693759765
"PRENATAL MENTAL HEALTH OF POOR WOMEN--SERVICES AND COSTS The primary purpose of this study is to determine the impact of prenatal         psychiatric disorders on birth outcomes, health service utilization and          costs.  Infant mortality and morbidity rates in this country continue            to exceed those of most industrialized countries.  For low-income women,         particularly African Americans and those with limited access to health           services, infant mortality and morbidity rates approximate those of              third-world countries.  Although biological, genetic and psychosocial            factors are linked to poor birth outcomes, one factor that has been              overlooked is prenatal psychiatric disorders, despite compelling                 evidence associating mental health problems with maternal-infant health.         Even less is known about how our health service delivery system                  contributes to poor birth outcomes through inadequate detection and              treatment of prenatal psychiatric disorders.  A better understanding of          how psychiatric illness influences the prenatal and postpartum use of            health services and costs is also needed.  This study will use a                 prospective cohort research design to compare outcomes between low-              income pregnant women with and without psychiatric disorders who are             stratified by race and urban-rural residence.  Using the Composite               International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the presence or absence of            current psychiatric disorders will first be determined in a sample of            1095 pregnant Medicaid recipients who receive services in Special                Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).           A sample of 219 pregnant women with current psychiatric diagnoses and            a comparison group of 211 pregnant women without psychiatric diagnoses           will be followed for three months postpartum to ascertain birth                  outcomes, use of health services and cost of these services.  Using              Birth certificate and Medicaid claims data, multiple or logistic                 regression will determine the independent effect of current psychiatric          disorders on birth outcomes and health service utilization rates,                controlling for other explanatory variables.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6131712,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2000,332039,111231681,0.02477878318247759
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.

"THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN Numerous case reports have demonstrated lead poisoning with potentially fatal consequences can result from retained lead projectiles following firearm injuries.  To assess the impact of retained projectiles on subsequent lead exposure, one cannot rely on self-selected cases presenting with symptoms of lead intoxication.  The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the morbidity associated with body lead burden as a result of retained bullets from firearm injuries.  The proposed investigation seeks to identify risk factors of elevated blood lead levels for individuals with retained lead bullets, establish appropriate protocols for lead testing, develop indications for bullet removal and provide guidelines for the appropriate management of fragments not removed. The study design included follow-up of 300 patients with retained lead bullets/bullet fragments presenting for acute care of firearm injury at large publicly owned Level 1 Trauma Center.  A baseline blood level is measured as soon after patient stabilization as possible and repeated at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.  Medical history regarding prior firearms injuries and other retained projectiles is taken, along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other sources of lead (occupational/recreational) to which the patient might have been or at present be exposed.  The patient will have K- shell X ray florescence determination of bone lead in the tibia and calcaneus in order to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnairer.  Multivariate models of blood level are made for each patient visit using risk factor and bone lead concentration data.  Determinations will be made if changes in blood lead, adjusted for risk factors and bone lead concentration, from one 3 month period to the next can be significantly predicted by the coded location and fragmentation data of projectiles and presence or absence of fractures.  The variables of location, fragmentation, fracture and total time during which the projectile was retained in the body will be tested using logistic regression.  This will determine odds ratios of elevated lead at various concentrations (greater than 15 mug/dL, greater than 25  mug/dL, greater than 40 mug/dL, etc.) due to these factors.  Data will also be analyzed in the framework of the general linear model (GML), with a repeated measure design.  Principal interest will be in increasing trend of blood level as a function of fragmentation location, fracture and duration variables.  n/a",THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN,6195278,R01ES010166,"['X ray', ' blood chemistry', ' clinical research', ' environmental exposure', ' foreign body reaction', ' human morbidity', ' human subject', ' injury', ' lead', ' lead poisoning', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' questionnaires', ' radiofluorescent probe', ' statistics /biometry']",NIEHS,CHARLES R.

There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders. TLC-M users in both studies will be queried regarding their             satisfaction with TLC-M.                                                                                                                                                  n/a",AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY,6041695,R01CA084447,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' counseling', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' telecommunications', "" women's health""]",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2000,475715,61416950,0.025659534372632027
"COMMUNITY-SITE CORONARY RISK CONTROL IN BLACK FAMILIES This study tests the effectiveness of Neighborhood Health Worker/Nurse           Case Management compared with usual care (referral to usual primary care         source) for the management of coronary heart disease risk factors in             African American siblings of persons with premature coronary disease.            Index patients with documented coronary disease prior to 60 years of age         will be recruited from 7 Baltimore hospitals to identify 480 siblings            to be screened to identify those with a criterion risk factor (LDL-              cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl, blood pressure greater than 140/90           mmHg, and/or cigarette smoking) (n=433).  Eligible siblings are those            between 30 and 60 years of age with no known coronary disease.  Siblings         with criterion risk factors after screening will be randomly assigned            by family to receive care in the community by a case management team             consisting of a Neighborhood Health Worked guided by a nurse and                 cardiologist, or to receive usual care.  Siblings will be followed one           year after screening to determine the proportion in each group who meet          goal levels of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, dietary fat, physical            activity, and smoking cessation.  The study builds on prior work in both         the African American community and in siblings that shows that 1.) nurse         managed care produces more successful risk reduction, 2.) African                Americans accept care in the community and from Neighborhood Health              Workers, and 3.) sociocultural models of care are more likely to be              successful in high risk African American families.  The goal is to               increase the proportion of high risk siblings who achieve goals based            on national guidelines.  This is one of the first studies to empirically         examine a combination of community intervention for multiple risk factor         reduction using indigenous workers and approaches which address the              needs of individuals with a documented family history of premature               coronary heart disease.  Analysis will include the test of proportions           achieving goals and multiple logistic regression analysis predicting             favorable change, adjusted for intra-family clustering of baseline risk          factors.                                                                          n/a",COMMUNITY-SITE CORONARY RISK CONTROL IN BLACK FAMILIES,6184421,R18HL058625,"['African American', ' blood lipoprotein', ' blood pressure', ' body physical activity', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' community health services', ' coronary disorder', ' diabetes mellitus', ' diet therapy', ' dietary lipid', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' health care referral /consultation', ' health care service availability', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' nutrition related tag', ' siblings', ' smoking cessation']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R18,2000,566543,807432003,-0.004304178360015587
"STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-modal Well Woman intervention to prevent new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among young, low-income African American women with a history of repeated STDs.  The target group lives on or near the Chicago Westside, where women are plagued with some of the highest STD rates in the nation. The Specific Aim is to determine the effects of the randomized, controlled repeated measures trial on (a) the mediating outcomes--STD related social, psychological, and skill/behavioral factors, and (b) the health status outcome-laboratory-confirmed newly contracted STDs.  The intervention is case-managed by advanced practice nurses (APNs) and complemented by a social worker and peer educators.  The intervention has a 2 month intensive phase and a 10-month maintenance phase with evidence- based standardized and individualized STD-prevention strategies: STD diagnosis, treatment, teaching, and support by APNs; STD prevention classes led by peer educators; community referrals and retention strategies by a social worker; and partner classes, counseling, and referrals.  Subjects will be 670 women aged 18-29 years who have an index STD and at least 1 other STD in their histories.  Subject recruitment will occur at 4 publicly supported West Side clinics, and the intervention will be in the West Side Health Center, a new Cook County Health Services facility in the center of the area.  After baseline measures, the women will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups with the minimization subject distribution procedure, taking into account the history of intravenous drug use, number of sexual partners, sexual violence, and HIV seropositivity.  The control group will have usual care, STD urine screening, HIV testing (offered) and a minimal didactic experience until the 12-month measure is taken.  Then they will be offered a concentrated intervention.  A STD-Prevention Framework derived from a tested nursing model, Cox's Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior, will guide the overall intervention and the components.  Analyses include change scores, logistic regression, proportional odds regression and random regression analysis.  n/a",STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,6186896,R01NR004836,"['AIDS /HIV test', ' African American', ' HIV infections', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' communicable disease control', ' counseling', ' female', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' low socioeconomic status', ' nursing intervention', ' sex behavior', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' substance abuse related behavior', "" women's health"", ' young adult human (21-34)']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2000,720664,148463823,-0.03154628024100446
