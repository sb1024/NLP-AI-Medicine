"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,10102280,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38161,607172798
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,10194380,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38222,560644462
"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,10218102,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38527,550947887
"Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY In the healthy brain, white matter connections coordinate the speed and reliability of communication among spatially distributed regions. The transmission of neural information with fine temporal precision is crucial for executive function (EF), defined as the coordination of attention, memory, and inhibitory control for goal-directed actions crucial for survival, health, and well-being. Notably, EF undergoes protracted development throughout youth, and the development of executive deficits is present in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and ADHD. However, the degree to which transdiagnostic executive deficits arise due to abnormal development of white matter networks remains unknown. Existing neuroimaging studies of transdiagnostic executive deficits have been limited by 1) inadequate methods to assess neurodevelopmental patterns of spatially distributed brain regions, and 2) inadequate theories of neural communication at the level of macro-scale structural networks. Here we address the latter challenge by generalizing long-established theoretical principles and empirical observations of efficient neurotransmission at the microscale neuron level to the macroscale structural connectome by calculating transmission fidelity. Transmission fidelity models how efficiently a brain region embedded in the structural network can transmit messages to a target region with individually differing speed and reliability. Moreover, we address the former challenge by capitalizing on advances in network science and machine learning. Utilizing these methods is a promising direction for investigating abnormal brain development. In this proposal, we describe the application of a novel analysis of structural network maturation to study the manifestation of transdiagnostic executive deficits. Using a large sample of youth who completed cross-sectional neuroimaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=1,042), our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structural connectivity and EF across age. We will use an additional cross-sectional dataset enriched with youths presenting with psychopathology acquired through the Healthy Brain Network study (n=5,000) to generalize our findings to executive dysfunction. To quantify developmental norms, we will capitalize on our large-scale datasets to train a machine learning model that predicts expected ranges of healthy brain development. Furthermore, understanding within-person changes in brain structure and EF necessitates longitudinal data. We will longitudinally assess youths diagnosed with ADHD (n=50) or schizophrenia (n=50), and typically developing comparators (n=40). In this proposal, we aim to 1) delineate how age-related variation of brain network transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders, and 2) determine how within-individual development in transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction in ADHD and the psychosis spectrum. A better understanding of atypical inter-individual and within-individual developmental patterns of brain networks provides a framework towards precision medicine in neuropsychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individualized therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how developmental deviations from expected norms of brain maturation manifest as psychopathology. We propose to apply a novel method based on network science and machine learning to provide a new perspective on the brain’s developmental patterns that can manifest as executive deficits that span psychopathology. To delineate the typical and atypical development of executive function, we will develop a quantification of within-person longitudinal patterns of brain network maturation contextualized in predictions of developmental norms from unique large-scale neuroimaging datasets of youth.",Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology,10233459,F31MH126569,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Population Study', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'individualized medicine', 'inter-individual variation', 'large scale data', 'mental development', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'transmission process', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036,593605914
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects. This study will identify risk-factors for developing troublesome hoarding by integrating and analyzing clinical interviews and a web-based registry of adults that includes various medical and cognitive questionnaires and neurocognitive tests.",Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding,10253596,R01MH117114,"['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain Health Registry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compulsive Hoarding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Impairment', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Low income', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Self Assessment', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computing resources', 'disability', 'frailty', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'recruit', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,68363,188894159
"Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records Up to 100 million Americans live with ongoing pain, costing $635 billion annually. In the United States, there are more than 200,000 people living with SLE, a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with multi-organ involvement that disproportionately affects females and racial minorities. Living with a chronic disease such as SLE confers multiple challenges. Pain is a frequent self-reported symptom in SLE and is often one of the first symptoms of the disease. Despite treatment advances, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint. The management of pain in SLE has recently become more challenging because of the alarming epidemic of addiction and mortality attributed to opioid misuse. An estimated 31-46% of patients with SLE use prescription opioids. In one study, 70% of individuals using opioids used them for ≥1 year, and 22% were taking ≥2 opioid medications at the same time. Patients with SLE are nearly twice as likely as the general population to have opioid-related overdose hospitalizations. However, efforts to mitigate opioid misuse cannot be achieved without a detailed understanding and sustained investment in clinical research on the underlying mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain. Characterizing the burden of chronic pain in SLE is challenging on at least two counts. First, we lack data on the prevalence and burden of chronic pain in SLE, partly due to the absence of reliable approaches to identify patients with clinically significant pain in electronic health records (EHR). Second, there is a critical need to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms and correlates that drive the pain experience in SLE. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Titilola Falasinnu will use computational methods to increase the understanding of the clinical management chronic pain in SLE using EHR. In Aim 1, Dr. Falasinnu will develop a computational chronic pain phenotyping algorithm using diagnostic codes, pain scores, narrative clinic notes and medications extracted from the EHRs of two large healthcare systems (n~2,400). She will then use the algorithm to estimate chronic pain prevalence in a population-based registry (n~76,000). In Aim 2, Dr. Falasinnu will comprehensively phenotype biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pain using an existing registry of ~500 patients with SLE attending a multi-disciplinary pain center. Throughout the award, Dr. Falasinnu will build on her doctoral training as an epidemiologist and biostatistician to develop new skills in biomedical informatics to conduct impactful pain medicine research. These skills will include working with EHR and registry data, machine learning and natural language processing, pain science, grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical observation in pain medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Falasinnu will gain the skills needed to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator. Despite treatment advances in rheumatology, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition that disproportionately affects women and racial minorities. The proposed research uses electronic health records to characterize chronic pain and its biopsychosocial mechanisms in SLE. The information learned from the study is relevant to public health efforts to understand the burden and natural history of pain; and it is also relevant to NIAM’s mission of improving the understanding of biopsychosocial components of pain in rheumatology.",Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records,10192176,K01AR079039,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Clinics', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population-Based Registry', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'biomedical informatics', 'biopsychosocial', 'body map', 'career', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain management', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data registry', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain reduction', 'pain score', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'post-doctoral training', 'prescription opioid', 'profiles in patients', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographic variables', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track', 'text searching', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126252,560644462
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027,570146095
"Development of neurologic itch signature Abstract: Chronic itch is a global health problem affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. However, there is no objective biomarker to assess itch. Since itch results from activity in brain circuits through the participation of many brain regions, we suggest developing specific brain biomarkers to assess the disease states and treatment effects using functional brain imaging and machine learning. Developments of biomarkers are one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. In itch treatment, assessment of itch is an important indicator in understanding the progress of chronic itch and treatment effect. Currently, itch assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self-reports, which is inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological pruriceptive (itch-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of itch. In particular, self-report is not applicable for people who have a limited capacity to report itch such as infants, very young children, and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Addressing chronic itch is becoming a central morbidity in many dermatological diseases and a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a reliable biomarker for itch. Itch-related neural signals are a fundamental element of the itch sensation. Measuring these signals can be a reliable biomarker for itch. Recent advancement of brain imaging combined with machine learning algorithms has enabled development of brain activity-based biomarkers to assess various mental activities and brain functions. This advancement, together with ongoing progress of low- cost & high-performance MRI, will expand the feasibility of practical use of fMRI in medicine. A brain activity- based biomarker for itch (i.e., Neurologic Itch Signature, NIS) may dramatically improve the quality of diagnoses, treatments and clinical trials. Moreover, the NIS can be a promising biomarker for itch-related processing in the brain, which enables to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch. The aim of our research proposal is to develop the NIS. In particular, we will demonstrate (1) that the NIS will selectively respond to itch (i.e., unresponsive to pain) and (2) that the NIS can predict not only an existence of itch but also itch intensity, as these are fundamental requirements of biomarker for itch. To achieve this goal, we will obtain datasets of brain activity during various intensities of itch and pain stimuli and resting condition by using functional MRI (fMRI), and identify a characteristic brain activity pattern for itch (i.e., the NIS) by analyzing the datasets using a machine learning algorithm. We will test whether the created NIS can predict itch and severity of itch without prior information. The NIS will accelerate itch research and improve quality of diagnosis and treatment of itch, which will eventually help the many people who suffer from chronic itch. Relevant statement Our proposal is the first project to develop a brain activity-based biomarker for itch. Success of our proposal will eventually allow us to share an objective itch assessment using the biomarker with research institutes, hospitals and industries across the world to accelerate itch research, and improve diagnosis and assessment of itch treatment.",Development of neurologic itch signature,10193704,R21AR078940,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antipruritics', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Dermatologic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pruritus', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'chronic itch', 'cost', 'diagnosis quality', 'expectation', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurotransmission', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'phrases', 'primary endpoint', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,174695,157845771
"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study,10127376,K01MH122774,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'associated symptom', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'individualized medicine', 'large datasets', 'memory process', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'trauma exposure', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment research', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2021,176916,68331629
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604,254622553
"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment and patient selection in future clinical trials.",Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest,10105883,K23NS119794,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'American', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Propofol', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resuscitation', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomarker-driven', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural hypothermia', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological recovery', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,191538,685608202
"Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Converging evidence has linked the habenula (Hb), a small epithalamic structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling, to a wide range of affective, motivational, and motor functions. Abnormalities in Hb circuitry are increasingly implicated in psychiatric and behavioral disorders. In vivo Hb research has proceeded slowly, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that make it difficult to define and characterize this small region. Understanding of the Hb is especially limited in adolescence, a critical period marked by rapid maturation of the reward system and, often, the first emergence of psychiatric disorders. To address these gaps in basic and clinical neuroscience, our proposal leverages the unprecedented scale and quality of high-resolution neuroimaging data available through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the development of Hb function in early adolescence and its role in psychiatric illness onset. The proposed research builds on extensive work by our group to develop and refine Hb imaging methodology, including automated segmentation and a region of interest optimization approach that significantly improves Hb fMRI sensitivity, and is supported by substantial data from our laboratory. In independent samples of adult and adolescent healthy controls (HCs), we found a highly consistent pattern of positive Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cortical salience network (SN), as well as negative Hb iFC throughout the default mode network (DMN). Adults with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with anxiety and depression, including the amygdala and insula. Moreover, adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders had positive Hb iFC with the DMN, and this abnormal Hb-DMN iFC pattern was associated with anxiety severity across both healthy and clinical adolescents, while hyperconnectivity with SN and other expected Hb targets correlated with anhedonia. Building on our compelling findings to date, we propose to study Hb function at Baseline and Year 2 ABCD neuroimaging timepoints in relation to normative (Aim 1) and clinical (Aim 2) developmental trajectories. Subjects will comprise two cohorts of ~3000 adolescents each: clinical subjects, with significant past or current mood and anxiety symptoms, and HCs, with no history of psychiatric diagnoses or clinically significant symptoms. Study procedures will incorporate sophisticated preprocessing and denoising, optimized subject-level Hb definition, neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface mapping, and rigorous non-parametric statistics. Analyses will encompass both resting-state and task fMRI to characterize Hb iFC and activation during specific reward, loss, and inhibitory control processes. We will examine both group differences and associations with psychiatric symptom severity using hypothesis-driven as well as machine learning approaches.  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to advance basic and clinical neuroscientific understanding of the habenula, a small structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling and is increasingly implicated in psychiatric disorders. The technical difficulty of studying the habenula has limited in vivo research, especially in adolescent populations where psychiatric symptoms often first emerge. Using an optimize analysis approach and a large sample of high- resolution neuroimaging data from the ABCD study, we propose to comprehensively investigate habenula function in normative early adolescent development and in the onset and trajectory of adolescent mental illness.",Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study,10234369,R21MH126501,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Health', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epithalamic structure', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habenula', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'animal data', 'anxiety symptoms', 'automated segmentation', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'denoising', 'early adolescence', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'subclinical depression', 'tv watching']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,210000,199779478
"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation.

"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification.

"Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in loss of cognitive and bodily function, and no cure or effective treatment currently exists. While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein aggregation, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and metabolic defects, the exact mechanism of neuronal death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. The goal of this research project is to test whether molecular and cellular dysfunction can be transmitted from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To achieve this goal, we will first map the functional connectivity between regions of brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, observe how these connections change over the progression of the disease, and link these functional changes to behavioral phenotypes in animals. We will then profile levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in tissue from several brain regions in these same mice, and observe whether changes in immunometabolic state coincide in time and space with the functional connections measured by MRI. Successful completion of this work will test a potential mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease spreading through the brain, and provide a map of coupling between immune, metabolic, and functional pathology that could open new directions for future development of early disease diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein build-up, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and faulty metabolism, the exact mechanism of brain cell death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. We propose that the dysfunctional cellular state leading to brain cell death is transferred from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To test this idea, we will map paths of brain activity using neuroimaging in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, measure the corresponding levels of immune markers and metabolic function in each brain region, and then overlay these maps to understand how they correspond over the course of disease. This study combines cutting-edge neuroimaging and molecular assays along with machine learning and computational modeling to test a proposed mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease progression, with the potential to open new directions for pursuit of therapeutic strategies.",Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease,10217616,R21AG068532,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Control Animal', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'awake', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain cell', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'imaging approach', 'interest', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R21,2021,438028,68045551
"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed.

"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914,44711126
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,10138039,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'detection limit', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,534438,63611576
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209,227555357
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,10140263,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,598015,87297083
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973,227555357
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data.

"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative.

"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer framework', 'geometric structure', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979,415711940
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,10053725,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,656876,570146095
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730,32639530
"Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation. Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact, and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric, substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial (BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.  Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array) and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease. Cognitive and mood disorders occur more commonly in people with HIV than in the general population but the field still does not fully understand why and has no effective therapies for most of those who are affected. This project will take a new approach to understanding how cognition, mood, substance use, and medical characteristics cluster together and will identify new biological mechanisms associated with these conditions. The successful project could lead to new diagnostic tests and therapies for these disorders, which would have substantial public health relevance.",Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER,10161628,R01MH125720,"['AIDS dementia', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain imaging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Store', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gut associated lymphoid tissue', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'disease classification', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,708875,524978793
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138,44711126
"Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients Project Summary Primary characteristics of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include persistent fears and excessive maladaptive avoidance behaviors. Preclinical models of PTSD have heavily investigated the brain mechanisms of fear inhibition and active avoidance learning. Significant progress has been made in translating fear conditioning and extinction data into the human brain and their implications have helped further our understanding of PTSD psychopathology. The mechanisms of active avoidance, however, have scarcely been examined in the human brain, especially within the context of maladaptive responses as in the case of PTSD. The studies proposed in this application are designed to begin to fill this scientific gap. We will use a novel conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP) to examine the neural correlates of active avoidance and fear extinction learning and explore how extinction modulates active avoidance responses in participants with and without a PTSD diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). PTSD psychopathology involves dysfunctional limbic-frontal activity including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus (HPC), and amygdala. Studies of avoidance in rodents and a few fMRI studies in healthy humans suggest that the vmPFC and striatum mediate threat response by toggling the expression of fear vs. avoidance responses. Participants (healthy controls with trauma exposure, and patients diagnosed with PTSD) will undergo the novel (validated) two- day CAAP. On day 1, participants will undergo Pavlovian fear conditioning, immediately followed by an active avoidance conditioning phase. Avoidance is achieved by pressing a button to prevent a shock from occurring but will not terminate the conditioned stimulus (CS). Pavlovian fear extinction learning (button removed; no avoidance possible) will follow. On day 2, recall of extinction learning will be tested. Before the start of the recall test, participants will receive a small monetary endowment and will be told that this money could be used to pay for shock avoidance during the recall test. The first aim is to Identify neural correlates of active avoidance. The second aim is to study activations after the CS+ terminates that index the relief from the avoided shock. The third aim is to examine neural correlates of extinction-to-avoidance transfer. The proposed studies are expected to provide a more integrated mechanistic understanding of the psychopathology of PTSD and reduce the gap between the rodent literature and human neuroimaging in avoidance research. Project Narrative The experiments proposed aim to examine the neural mechanisms of active avoidance learning and explore how these mechanisms are modulated by fear extinction learning circuits. We will use a novel conditioning and avoidance paradigm to gather functional MRI and subjective reports data from healthy controls and from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The anticipated impact is to enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive avoidance responses, reduce the translation gap in this area between rodents and human studies, and explore potential novel targets for advancing the treatment of PTSD.",Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients,10211625,R01MH123736,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Endowment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Price', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'learning extinction', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'trauma exposure', 'willingness to pay']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,756037,329565273
"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Abstract  Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and illness severity. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative For years it has been hypothesized that psychiatric disorders are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development, though there is little direct evidence to support that hypothesis. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a longitudinal study that has followed children with imaging and developmental assessments from birth to age 10 years. We will study brain structure and function in these children at 12, 14, and 16 years with MRI to see if we can identify childhood predictors of behavior in adolescence that is considered at risk for psychiatric illness, which will ultimately help target periods of childhood development for early intervention.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10206731,R01MH123747,"['10 year old', '12 year old', '16 year old', '4 year old', '8 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Puberty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'adolescent brain development', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain abnormalities', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'executive function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'postnatal period', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'sex', 'social', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,763760,511185245
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655,338121506
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10216953,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,796409,558628098
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,10160747,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,833908,327644200
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511,68331629
"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools.

"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559,254622553
"Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning Abstract This application will combine the strengths of two large scale NIH-funded initiatives to understand disorder- related patterns in the human brain: Connectomes Related to Human Disease (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA). We will develop and evaluate novel brain vulnerability metrics - based on the idea of polygenic risk scores – that we expect to better predict diagnosis and cognitive performance than standard neuroimaging measures. We define a metric of “vulnerability” by quantifying the similarity between each individual's brain pattern and deficit patterns in neuropsychiatric disorders. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) uses Big Data meta-analyses to quantify the similarity between an individual and meta-analytical deficit effect size patterns based on large and diverse international samples. The Machine Learning-Vulnerability Index (MVI) is trained using Big Data mega-analytic samples to quantify the similarity for individual brain patterns to those learned from patients and controls. We will compute novel, cross-domain vulnerability metrics to phenotype each of the N=3,350 CHRD individuals across three mainly psychiatric (schizophrenia-spectrum and psychosis disorder, major depression, and bipolar disorder), three mainly neurological (epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) and three neuroimaging domains (structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI). Our Specific Aims merge CRHD and ENIGMA data to test four hypotheses: 1) Neuropsychiatric illnesses not only impact an isolated region or circuit, but are associated with deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that can be unique to each illness; 2) such deficit patterns are informative of cognitive deficits in patients; 3) similarity with the deficit patterns will have higher specificity and sensitivity than any traditional neuroimaging metric or trait; and 4) similarity at the voxel- and vertex-based level may lead to development of high-resolution vulnerability indices. We will test these hypotheses by performing patient-control sensitivity and specificity analyses in the corresponding CRHD illness groups; study the degree of separation vs. commonality across psychiatric and neurological disorders; and evaluate pattern differences at specific stages of the illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease. We will use multivariate mediation analyses to link vulnerability to variance in cognitive domains ascertained by CHRD. This short, intensive project will benefit the community-at-large by populating the CHRD/HCP database with novel multimodal brain phenotypes extracted and homogenized using standard ENIGMA workflows, enriched with Open Science approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE The Connectomes Related to Human Disease/Human Connectome Project (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) are two large scale NIH-funded initiatives exploring disorder-related patterns in the human brain. The two projects are complementary: CRHD focuses on in-depth, high-resolution multimodal phenotyping of the brain connectome in modest samples, whereas ENIGMA's analyses harness the statistical power of large and inclusive, worldwide samples. We propose combining the strengths of CRHD and ENIGMA to test novel biomarkers based on replicable and consistent illness deficit patterns provided by Big Data studies. We posit that major brain illnesses do not impact an isolated region or brain circuit but rather lead to deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that are shared or unique to an illness; such deficit patterns are highly replicable and linked to severity, duration and treatment resistance. We will develop and evaluate a multivariate vulnerability model based on (1) the degree of similarity between an individual's brain patterns and expected disorder patterns defined as a linear combination of deficits - conceptually similar to polygenic risk scores - and (2) a vulnerability metric computed using machine learning. We will test the specificity and sensitivity of these models against the single most discriminative neuroimaging traits in six diagnostic categories shared by CRHD and ENIGMA: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) and psychosis, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorders (BP), epilepsy (EP), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will use multivariate analyses to compare sensitivity and specificity of the regional vulnerability index (RVI) and machine learning vulnerability (MVI) in separating patients and controls in the CHRD samples, mapping unique and shared deficit patterns across six diagnostic categories. We will link vulnerability metrics to cognitive outcomes and diagnosis using mediation analyses. Finally, we will enrich vulnerability models with CHRD's connectomics based phenotypes including cortical myelination to advance white matter integrity measurements for future large-scale ENIGMA studies.",Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning,10186960,RF1MH123163,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heritability', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'open data', 'polygenic risk score', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,RF1,2021,1220179,230060143
"Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling The human brain is an unimaginably complicated system of interconnected neurons that is capable of complex thought, emotion and behavior. Macroscale white matter connections quantified via the structural connectome (SC) act as the backbone for the flow of functional activation, which can be represented via the functional con- nectome (FC). Our group and others have shown that quantifying properties of the brain’s structural and func- tional connectomes and their relationship can inform understanding of brain-behavior associations and disease mechanisms4-9. However, models that describe SC-FC relationships have only achieved moderate agreement with observations and have not been used to fully explore the heritability and cognitive implications of structure- function coupling in adult and developing populations. If we do not accurately understand how the brain’s anat- omy and physiology are linked across the human lifespan, then we will not be able to quantify the impact of disease or pathological developmental trajectories. Our long-term goal is to create computational tools for stud- ying the brain’s structure and function, particularly in the context of disease. The overarching objective of this project is to create a model that accurately {and interpretably} quantifies the coupling between the structural and functional connectomes in both sexes, which will in turn allow us to investigate the heritability and cognitive implications of SC-FC coupling across developing and adult populations. Our central hypothesis is that a {hybrid approach to predicting FC from SC, combining both biophysical modeling and deep learning,} will be more ac- curate than existing techniques. Based on the prior literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SC- FC coupling will vary with sex, be heritable, associated with development, and explain inter-subject variability in cognition. Our hypothesis is supported by preliminary data from our group and others that show SC-FC relation- ships are heritable and vary with sex and cognition in patients7,18. The rationale for this work is that having an accurate model of the SC-FC relationship in healthy populations, which currently does not exist, will further our understanding of the complex relationship between anatomy, physiology, sex, genetics and cognition. We will test the central hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) identify the most accurate model for predicting FC from SC, 2) quantify the heritability of SC-FC coupling and its association with cognitive performance and 3) characterize the SC-FC coupling trajectory and its cognitive implications throughout development. We will use neuroimaging, genetic and cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project, including young adult (~1000 individuals, 22- 37 years) and developing populations (~650 individuals, 5-21 years). The approach is innovative, as it proposes to use model-driven, data-driven and hybrid approaches to model SC-FC relationships and that it poses to ex- plore sex effects, heritability, cognitive and developmental implications of SC-FC relationships. The proposed research is significant in that understanding structure-function relationships across typical development will allow quantification of the impact of disease and reveal avenues for novel treatments in various neurological diseases. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the relationship between brain anatomy, physiology, genetics and cognition throughout human development is paramount to understanding of how it can break down in disease. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NICHD's mission in that it seeks to understand human development and optimize abilities for all.",Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling,10189014,RF1MH123232,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sex Differences', 'Ships', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genome-wide', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,RF1,2021,1292521,227555357
"Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram Project Abstract: Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram Although cognitive decline is a “normal” part of aging, some individuals clearly age better than others. However, the concept of differential aging has been minimally studied for the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations signals carry rich information regarding brain health and brain aging. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with fragmented sleep and altered sleep oscillations. Clearance of cerebral beta amyloid through the brain's glymphatic drainage system occurs mainly in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and depends on EEG slow oscillations. Cortical generators of sleep EEG oscillations overlap with regions of cortical thinning and loss of functional connectivity in AD. Disturbances of NREM disrupt memory consolidation. Finally, deficient REM sleep contributes to dementia. These observations suggest that brain health may be measurable from information contained in the sleep EEG. In preliminary work we have developed EEG-brain age – a machine learning model that predicts a patient's age based on patterns of overnight sleeping EEG oscillations. This allows prediction of age with a precision of +/- 7 years. Our preliminary data suggest diabetes and hypertension, chronic HIV infection, an MCI or AD are reflected in the EEG as excessive brain age, and that excessive brain age is independently associated with reduced life expectancy. Our central hypothesis is that sleep physiology data can provide sensitive and specific biomarkers of brain health. This hypothesis is based on our prior work showing that BAI is elevated in several clinical populations. BAI can be accurately calculated using frontal EEG signals, making it suitable for implementation on at-home EEG devices. The rationale for the proposed research is that validating sleep EEG-derived biomarkers as measures of brain health at the level of individual patients would lay the ground for use in clinical trials and patient care. We plan to accomplish the central objective by pursuing two complementary aims. In Aim 1, we will take a hypothesis-driven approach, and test for associations of specific sleep features with specific cognitive deficits and specific structural pathology. In Aim 2, we will take ad data-driven approach, and develop optimized biomarkers of brain health using a novel form of machine learning known as multitask learning, which combine multiple features of sleep – including conventional features, as well as data-driven features directly learned from the data – to predict or “explain” variation in cognitive performance and in structural brain MRI measures that are indicative of brain health or disease. The project will take advantage of a large and diverse set of sleep data (>33,000 patients), as well as thousands of brain MRI and cognitive testing results. At the conclusion of this study, we expect to have a better understanding of the role sleep oscillations play in brain health, and clinically useful brain health biomarkers. These outcomes will aid development of interventions to promote brain health. Project Narrative: Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram RELEVANCE: Loss of brain function including memory and executive function is an inevitable part of aging, yet some individuals' brains age better than others. We recently developed the brain age index – a statistical model that reports the difference between an individual's apparent brain age, based on the pattern of overnight EEG (brain waves), and their chronologic age. This project will use existing data from 4 large cohorts to further develop and validate sleep EEG-based biomarkers of brain health, by characterizing the relationships of brain waves during sleep to cognitive health and to the structural health of the brain.",Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram,10180268,RF1NS120947,"['20 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Archives', 'Arousal', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Claustral structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drainage procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'General Hospitals', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Koreans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Smoker', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'basal forebrain', 'base', 'brain health', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'functional loss', 'glymphatic system', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multi-task learning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'sleep physiology', 'sleep spindle', 'specific biomarkers', 'therapy development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,RF1,2021,2494802,551214295
