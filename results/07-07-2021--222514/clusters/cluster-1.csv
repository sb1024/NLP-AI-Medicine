"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations,10148997,R01DK058816,"['Age', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Budgets', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cyst', 'Cystic kidney', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Other Genetics', 'PRKCSH protein', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Proprotein Convertase 2', 'Proteins', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'dosage', 'early onset', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polycystic liver disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapy development', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,15035,276703803,0.04710065795329706
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,294146927,-0.04926883153006467
"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10065897,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,31454,533594881,0.01596159387851598
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,9907858,F30HD098803,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,593605914,0.03174906151892374
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9893712,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'driver mutation', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,65310,77336088,0.03240774276005207
"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10039384,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2020,94262,167717872,0.054177835653328
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF. I propose to develop a tool to find all the transcription factors in the human genome that can turn ON target genes.",HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS,9856466,K99GM131022,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'activating transcription factor', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging platform', 'in vivo', 'learning classifier', 'model building', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,99998,533594881,0.029457919832447797
"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. This project will address the regulation of this transcriptome imbalance and its impact on the functional health of the proteome and the multi-morbidity in aged individuals.",Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity,10040210,K99AG068544,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Bioethics', 'Biology of Aging', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Geroscience', 'Global Change', 'Glutamine', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune', 'Immunologist', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Polymerase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell age', 'genome-wide', 'healthspan', 'immune function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'influenza A pneumonia', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pneumonia model', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'proteostasis', 'resilience', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stoichiometry', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,122861,66720547,0.022948324366487853
"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort,10041649,R03DE029800,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'American', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine System', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Laboratories', 'Lacrimal gland structure', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'differential expression', 'disease heterogeneity', 'epigenome', 'eye dryness', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'methylation testing', 'monocyte', 'multiple omics', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,161500,685608202,0.037208221540261495
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",9873379,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,188250,113554200,0.016633521299540897
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9948713,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,190941,560644462,0.0691471248833793
"Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement Project Summary/Abstract The mandate of the PsychENCODE Data Analysis Core (DAC) includes the development of novel integrative methodologies to construct a coherent interpretational framework for the data emerging from the consortium. The complexity of building such a framework lies in the diversity of experimental assays and their associated confounding factors, as well as in the inherent uncertainty regarding how the various target biological components function together. As a result, any analytical and computational methods would need to capture this high dimensionality of structure in the data. While classical, parallel computation advances at an incredible pace and continues to serve the needs of the research community, our experience with the ever- increasing complexity of neuropsychiatric datasets has motivated us to also look at other promising technological avenues. Accordingly, motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum computing (QC), we herein explore the use of QC algorithms as applied to two problems of relevance to the PsychENCODE DAC: (1) the prediction of brain-specific enhancers based on variants and functional genomic assays (Aim S1; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant); and (2) the calculation of the contributions of cell types to tissue-level gene expression and to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Aim S2; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant). The nascency of QC hardware technologies and the complexity of simulating quantum algorithms on classical computing resources means that our exploration will be confined to smaller, judiciously chosen datasets.Nevertheless, the work in this supplement will serve to evaluate future prospects for the use of QC algorithms and hardware in genomic analyses. We also consider two different paradigms of QC, the quantum annealer and the quantum gate model, and weigh their efficiency relative to classical computing. Finally, we will incorporate the QC and classical predictions into PsychENCODE consortium's database and online portal for visualizing the relationships between different genetic and genomic elements, and evaluate corroborating evidence for the predictions (Aim S3; related to Aim 2 of the parent grant). Project Narrative The PsychENCODE consortium has conducted extensive functional genomic analyses of samples from individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders aim to discover the complex biological architecture that lead from genetic and epigenetic markers of disease to the observed phenotypes. To reveal this underlying structure, the consortium relies on the use of sophisticated computational methods, including machine learning techniques, implemented on cutting-edge massively parallel computing resources by the consrtium’s Data Analysis Core (DAC). However, the scale and complexity of the tasks place significant burdens on these resources, and suggest the need for exploring alternative computing hardware technologies. This supplement to the DAC parent grant evaluates the promise of the emerging field of quantum computing to speed up large-scale computations and more efficiently explore the model landscape, using a comparative analysis of classical and quantum computing algorithms applied to problems relevant to the PsychENCODE DAC: the annotation of brain-specific enhancers and the quantification of cell-type contributions to bulk tissue gene expression.",Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement,10047746,U01MH116492,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'data framework', 'design', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high dimensionality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'parent grant', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'quantum computing', 'simulation', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,195697,294146927,0.01829309790764605
"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria. Upon completion, this project will provide a global view of the interplay between recombination and adaptative evolution across hundreds of bacterial species.",Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes,9968563,R01GM132137,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Spottings', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'gene function', 'genome analysis', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'homologous recombination', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'novel strategies', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R01,2020,294378,8388719,0.023465962920963784
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine.

"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases. It will also facilitate the translation of basic research findings into clinical studies.",Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data,9972090,R01GM134005,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome Scan', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,328257,550947887,0.0730562681181495
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,1526571,0.024898934933268592
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9925808,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,399965,558628098,0.0359129312081931
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,511185245,0.0032249603908358427
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,9946710,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2020,418577,2689914,0.03173183223616033
"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10047366,R35HG011297,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'hearing impairment', 'large datasets', 'molecular diagnostics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,466172,533302350,0.046993013699994354
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9938688,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,63682180,0.024095619855975338
"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10034691,R01GM138597,"['Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'electronic data', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486125,593605914,0.025722083963166744
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9820729,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,508845,193405667,0.06754080280169028
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium. This work will identify new genetic causes and dissect ciliary defects associated with genetic mutations.",Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome,9988508,R01NS048453,"['Apraxias', 'Ataxia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar malformation', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cilia', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognitive', 'Congenital cerebellar hypoplasia', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Embryo', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Kidney', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molar tooth', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Muscle hypotonia', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Sonication', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Termination of pregnancy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Training', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'accurate diagnosis', 'affection', 'base', 'cell type', 'cilium biogenesis', 'cohort', 'consanguineous family', 'disorder subtype', 'early childhood', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'fetal', 'founder mutation', 'gene discovery', 'genetic testing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'loss of function mutation', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'population based', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'screening', 'stem cell biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,510012,524978793,0.0408994474829211
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations,9976498,R01DK058816,"['Age', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Budgets', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cyst', 'Cystic kidney', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Other Genetics', 'PRKCSH protein', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Proprotein Convertase 2', 'Proteins', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'dosage', 'early onset', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polycystic liver disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapy development', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,510292,276703803,0.04710065795329706
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9999533,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision drugs', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,525099,324592664,0.04993889559613653
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",9867736,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,607933,329565273,0.08731787232475752
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9873080,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'functional/structural genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'stem cells', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways.

"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,9974137,R01EY019474,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,764279,304670088,0.017890834347718865
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10051655,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,790452,176988430,0.004866633100657485

"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering R&D, target discovery and personalized therapy development.","Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening",10080433,R44HG011442,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR therapeutics', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chromatids', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Hybridizations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polyploidy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiation', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister Chromatid', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'density', 'experimental study', 'fluorophore', 'gene therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genomic profiles', 'genotoxicity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'personalized medicine', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'screening', 'stem cells', 'structural genomics', 'technological innovation', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"KROMATID, INC.",R44,2020,1088162,1088162,0.046784432901815366
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9928344,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2020,1186500,178569161,0.04719355839762555
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,9760051,F30HD098803,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2019,50016,593605914,0.03174906151892374
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9683394,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,77336088,0.03240774276005207
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9629655,R03AI128227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allergic Disease', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic inflammatory skin', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'screening', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2019,69485,6013508,0.04372210995226141
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9695242,K99HG009920,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enhancers', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plasmids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biochemical model', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized medicine', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'skills', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,90935,191864802,0.03457508088645618
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF. I propose to develop a tool to find all the transcription factors in the human genome that can turn ON target genes.",HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS,9646957,K99GM131022,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'activating transcription factor', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging platform', 'in vivo', 'model building', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,99998,533594881,0.029457919832447797
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,9655203,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,151994,10977604,0.0271234759390435
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9689882,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172364,90243698,-0.005395064226354281
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9786811,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,190941,560644462,0.0691471248833793
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9616870,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,297373,507546965,0.09254735592187849
"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects. Here, Basepair will develop an inclusive suite of software for PGT-A, compatible with sequencing data from multiple platforms.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9801992,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,319720,74382276,0.029799293951692493
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States.

"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9786822,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,399965,558628098,0.0359129312081931
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,511185245,0.0032249603908358427
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9749268,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,430191,90243698,0.06291438615907177
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9706661,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,63682180,0.024095619855975338
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9593020,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hearing threshold', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,480576,193405667,0.06754080280169028
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD.

"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9767099,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,530660,324592664,0.04993889559613653
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",9645655,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,615264,329565273,0.08731787232475752
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9654772,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'functional/structural genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9634922,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Structural Genes', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,714430,90419233,0.08858908204754515
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9692399,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial tissue', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,724926,593605914,0.08119621187331078
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,9740637,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Apical', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Translating', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'c new', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung cancer screening', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,790346,558628098,0.020255557851139833
"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9693289,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,864186,117374875,0.07866608476597935
"NEIGHBORHOOD Consortium for POAG Genetics Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure (IOP) related, progressive optic neuropathy that ultimately leads to blindness. Permanent visual field loss from POAG is a condition of public health significance worldwide. The etiology of POAG is poorly understood and primary prevention is not possible. Current treatments can slow but do not cure this progressive neuropathy. The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG allowing for implementation of effective screening and prevention strategies and development of novel therapies. POAG has significant heritability and recent genome-wide association studies, including our NEIGHBORHOOD GWAS, have identified 30 POAG loci defined by common genomic variants. However, in addition to common variants the complex POAG genetic architecture is likely to also include contributions from rare coding variants as has been discovered for other complex traits. Large-scale studies of rare coding variation and glaucoma have not yet been done. Of the current POAG loci, the majority appear to contribute to disease through elevation of IOP. However, approximately one third of U.S. glaucoma cases are ‘normal’ tension (NTG), charaterized by progressive optic nerve degeneration despite normal IOP. Our prior NTG GWAS identified two loci: 8q22, a loci not found in POAG GWASs and CDKN2BAS, a locus known to effect ganglion cell vulnerability. There results suggest that genes associated with NTG can influence susceptiblity to optic nerve degeneration, and that identification of these optic-nerve-related loci is more likely using NTG cases and controls for GWAS, rather than POAG overall. For the next funding period we propose the following specific aims: 1) complete a larger-scale well-powered NTG GWAS to discover novel loci; 2) assess contributions of rare coding variants to NTG and high-tension POAG (HTG) using whole exome sequencing; 3) explore potential protective effects of dietary factors and medications on cases with high-risk variants in POAG loci related to lipid metabolism and to mitochondrial function; and 4) support additional clinical data collection for the NEIGHBORHOOD. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) causes permanent loss of vision and is a condition of public health significance worldwide, affecting millions of people. The etiology of POAG is poorly understood and effective means of primary prevention and curative therapies are not available. In this proposal, our collaborative consortium will complete genetic studies to identify risk factors for POAG and the normal tension subgroup with the ultimate goals of developing effective screening and prevention strategies and novel therapies targeted to the molecular events responsible for the disease.",NEIGHBORHOOD Consortium for POAG Genetics,9819220,R01EY022305,"['ATP binding cassette transporter 1', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Blindness', 'CAV1 gene', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dietary Factors', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropathy', 'Optic Nerve', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Visual Fields', 'Vitamin B Complex', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'ganglion cell', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'lipid metabolism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optic nerve disorder', 'protective effect', 'protective factors', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,872775,32639530,-0.06754684462811612
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9751141,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2019,1186500,178569161,0.04719355839762555
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9748023,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Audiometry', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,53375,193405667,0.06754080280169028
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9456064,R03AI128227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allergic Disease', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic inflammatory skin', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'novel', 'screening', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2018,69617,6013508,0.04372210995226141
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease.

"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9445540,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,177833,90243698,-0.005395064226354281
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9666548,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,190941,560644462,0.0691471248833793
"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9416160,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA library', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'targeted nucleases', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2018,242325,13443779,0.03187445617371134
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9405576,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,297619,507546965,0.09254735592187849
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.

"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown.

"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9544417,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,399949,558628098,0.0359129312081931
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9543532,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,400001,511185245,0.0032249603908358427
"Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelomeningocele (MM), the most common type of spina bifida (SB) (>90% of cases), affects 1 in  2,500 live births in the United States and is the most severe subtype of neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival. Mexican Americans (MexA) have the highest prevalence rate in the US with Caucasians Americans (CauA) second. An estimated lifetime of medical care costs (up to 65 years of age) for an individual affected with MM is ~$806,000 (2007 dollars). Occurrence of MM represents a significant economic and public health burden. Genetic contribution to formation of NTDs is complex as is illustrated by the e 240 known mouse models. However, the majority of these mouse models have rostral NTDs while only a handful present with the SB phenotype indicating that SB is more genetically homogeneous. Genetic variation underlying susceptibility and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the development of human MM is largely unknown. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most cost-effective tool to discover all frequency of variations in the exome. We hypothesize that the genetic architecture of MM is comprised of novel/de novo genetic variants identifiable in the exomes of MM subjects by WES, unique variants present in genes known to associate with MM, and genetic variation in novel genes. This proposal utilizes WES to investigate the extent to which rare, novel or de novo variants play a role in human MM.  Our immediate objective is to characterize the full spectrum of allelic variations in genes and pathways unique to the exomes of MM subjects to reveal the genetic variability. We will use an enhanced WES protocol to interrogate genetic variations in the exomes of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects. Ethnic specific variations will be filtered using an exome variation database built from 1,547 MexA exomes of the T2D-GENES project and from 2,649 CauA exomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project to obtain novel variations. De novo variations will be determined by examining unaffected parents. Characterization of deleterious variants will be determined by functional prediction algorithms. To identify variants influencing MM susceptibility, we will perform logistic regression analysis and gene-based burden tests on genes and pathways according to the rare allele frequency. We will identify variants influencing MM susceptibility prioritized by effect sizes and predicted functional impacts. We will verify association of genes influencing MM susceptibility. Significance of variations in genes and pathways will also be evaluated by meta-analyses. We will replicate ten genes prioritized by occurrence of novel variants, effect sizes and functional impacts in an additional cohort of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects to verify their influence on MM susceptibility. Completion of the proposed project will define the role of novel/de novo variants to MM susceptibility and create an MM specific exome variants resource that can facilitate future research directions including translation to clinical diagnosis, prediction of outcome and designing treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelomeningocele (MM) is the most severe form of open neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival and affected individuals have lifelong disabilities. With approximately 1 in 2,500 live births in the United States affected each year, MM represents a huge public health problem as the estimated economic burden in medical care costs alone is~$806,000 in 2007 dollars for an affected individual up to age 65 years. Because little is known about the genetic variations that contribute to causality of MM, we propose to examine exomes of 500 MM subjects to identify unique variations in genes and pathways influencing MM susceptibility that can be used to facilitate future research and clinical care for improved diagnostics, outcome prediction and treatment. 1",Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map,9483731,R01HD073434,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alleles', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Meningomyelocele', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mexican Americans', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'caucasian American', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,419617,135644722,0.09495838576893699
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9555069,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,457798,90243698,0.06291438615907177
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9527869,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472477,63682180,0.024095619855975338
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9580729,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,562135,324592664,0.04993889559613653
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9393258,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Audiometry', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,564086,193405667,0.06754080280169028
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9433692,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. No changes from original submission Contact PD/PI: Chakravarti, Aravinda The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9478321,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial tissue', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,692794,593605914,0.08119621187331078
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9467545,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,759253,90419233,0.08858908204754515
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9483341,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,864186,117374875,0.07866608476597935
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9562959,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2018,1186500,178569161,0.04719355839762555
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9536132,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2018,3291017,178569161,0.05281627060486018
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups.

"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9241329,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,195000,507546965,0.03453428678784594
"Estimating disease risk using genetic data Project Summary In the past 10 years, over 21,000 genetic variants have been linked to complex human traits through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the predictive power of many of these variants remains limited, and it is still unclear how best to use the wealth of information generated by GWAS to impact personal health and clinical practice. For nearly 10 years, 23andMe has been not only a driving force in direct-to-consumer genetic testing but also has established an innovative crowd-sourced genetics research platform. This platform has yielded a compelling data resource and many genetic discoveries. In this proposal, we will address the next phase of 23andMe human genetics research: the development of highly scalable and accurate disease risk estimation. Two of the key challenges in human genetics research are (1) to determine how to use results of GWAS to paint an accurate picture of an individual's disease risk, and (2) to determine how these estimates can provide information of personal and clinical utility. These challenges are difficult due to many factors including the wide spectrum of disease classes, the paucity of genetic and phenotypic data and significant methodological and computational challenges. In this proposal, we present a plan to utilize the genetic and phenotypic data stores at 23andMe to ​develop validated risk estimation algorithms​. In Phase I, we will build a computational pipeline that will be used to develop predictive algorithms for estimating disease risk (Aim #1) and use this pipeline to evaluate predictive ability of different estimation approaches in a broad class of human complex traits (Aim #2). In Phase II, we will validate these algorithms in external cohorts and build customer-facing reports that we will test for user comprehension. We believe that the development of accurate risk estimation capability will have a major impact on both consumer genetics and clinical genetics markets.      Project Narrative   The promise of genetics-based estimation of disease risk has yet to be realized. In this project, 23andMe will use its database of genetic and phenotypic information from over 1,000,000 research participants who have contributed more than 285,000,000 phenotypic data points on a wide spectrum of disease to build risk estimation algorithms. This project will enable 23andMe to produce the first validated risk estimation algorithms that provide both personal and clinical utility.    ",Estimating disease risk using genetic data,9255753,R43HG009089,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myopia', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'crowdsourcing', 'data resource', 'disorder risk', 'driving force', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'health practice', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'trait']",NHGRI,"23ANDME, INC.",R43,2017,241905,0,0.051343886617147574
"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9258454,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA library', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2017,244439,13443779,0.03187445617371134
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9207474,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,297842,507546965,0.09254735592187849
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9306198,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,352350,90710179,0.053249802225784446
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9459529,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,400000,511185245,0.0032249603908358427
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9301667,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'user friendly software', 'web app', 'whole genome']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,430578,246330700,0.06994087872946188
"Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelomeningocele (MM), the most common type of spina bifida (SB) (>90% of cases), affects 1 in  2,500 live births in the United States and is the most severe subtype of neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival. Mexican Americans (MexA) have the highest prevalence rate in the US with Caucasians Americans (CauA) second. An estimated lifetime of medical care costs (up to 65 years of age) for an individual affected with MM is ~$806,000 (2007 dollars). Occurrence of MM represents a significant economic and public health burden. Genetic contribution to formation of NTDs is complex as is illustrated by the e 240 known mouse models. However, the majority of these mouse models have rostral NTDs while only a handful present with the SB phenotype indicating that SB is more genetically homogeneous. Genetic variation underlying susceptibility and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the development of human MM is largely unknown. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most cost-effective tool to discover all frequency of variations in the exome. We hypothesize that the genetic architecture of MM is comprised of novel/de novo genetic variants identifiable in the exomes of MM subjects by WES, unique variants present in genes known to associate with MM, and genetic variation in novel genes. This proposal utilizes WES to investigate the extent to which rare, novel or de novo variants play a role in human MM.  Our immediate objective is to characterize the full spectrum of allelic variations in genes and pathways unique to the exomes of MM subjects to reveal the genetic variability. We will use an enhanced WES protocol to interrogate genetic variations in the exomes of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects. Ethnic specific variations will be filtered using an exome variation database built from 1,547 MexA exomes of the T2D-GENES project and from 2,649 CauA exomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project to obtain novel variations. De novo variations will be determined by examining unaffected parents. Characterization of deleterious variants will be determined by functional prediction algorithms. To identify variants influencing MM susceptibility, we will perform logistic regression analysis and gene-based burden tests on genes and pathways according to the rare allele frequency. We will identify variants influencing MM susceptibility prioritized by effect sizes and predicted functional impacts. We will verify association of genes influencing MM susceptibility. Significance of variations in genes and pathways will also be evaluated by meta-analyses. We will replicate ten genes prioritized by occurrence of novel variants, effect sizes and functional impacts in an additional cohort of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects to verify their influence on MM susceptibility. Completion of the proposed project will define the role of novel/de novo variants to MM susceptibility and create an MM specific exome variants resource that can facilitate future research directions including translation to clinical diagnosis, prediction of outcome and designing treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelomeningocele (MM) is the most severe form of open neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival and affected individuals have lifelong disabilities. With approximately 1 in 2,500 live births in the United States affected each year, MM represents a huge public health problem as the estimated economic burden in medical care costs alone is~$806,000 in 2007 dollars for an affected individual up to age 65 years. Because little is known about the genetic variations that contribute to causality of MM, we propose to examine exomes of 500 MM subjects to identify unique variations in genes and pathways influencing MM susceptibility that can be used to facilitate future research and clinical care for improved diagnostics, outcome prediction and treatment. 1",Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map,9260023,R01HD073434,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Meningomyelocele', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mexican Americans', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'caucasian American', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,444849,135644722,0.09495838576893699
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9403711,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Inflation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,464747,90243698,0.06291438615907177
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identifynovelcellsubtypesthroughchangesintheexpressionrelationshipsbetweengenes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expressionprofilesislikelytobenefitfromavarietyofapproaches.Inordertofindagreementbetweenthose approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9398289,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,472477,63682180,0.022186760398512025
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished work we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic mapping on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 5] Developed methods to ultrastructurally interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to JSRD, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in any proven JSRD gene lead to collapse of the ciliary transition zone by correlating genetic mutations with ultrastructural ciliary defects. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations within a mechanistic framework, and a model that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9232830,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Audiometry', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,564086,193405667,0.06754080280169028
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9331729,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,650526,593605914,0.08119621187331078
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9265137,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9302807,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Gene Library', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2017,737011,533302350,0.019981788944396277
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9320861,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2017,750000,178569161,0.05281627060486018
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9238774,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,770725,90419233,0.08858908204754515
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9275537,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Government', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,864186,117374875,0.07866608476597935
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9344966,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2017,1186500,178569161,0.04719355839762555
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9313321,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Privatization', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'heart rhythm', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'standard of care', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,1280593,367414121,0.05891790700171259
"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,8974432,K99HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Indium', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repaired', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2016,25020,191864802,0.03187445617371134
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the ‘early’ detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to its development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to finemap already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this twostage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 “convenience controls” f rom the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the ‘early’ subclinical phenotypes identified through the use of VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. Improving methods for the ‘early’ detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9353966,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cholesterol', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'therapy design/development', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,100384,90419233,0.08879651133383233
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,9288249,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,162125,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.            ",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9017369,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical sequencing', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,234000,507546965,0.03453428678784594
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8991063,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2016,237102,685608202,0.041684456794440536
"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9242250,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Indium', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repaired', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2016,246031,13443779,0.03187445617371134
"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.                ",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9055844,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,309883,507546965,0.09254735592187849
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9097781,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,352350,90710179,0.053249802225784446
"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,9118280,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'rare variant', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,380625,641965656,0.061845805015861274
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,9115225,R01HL128234,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Platelet Disorders', 'Blood Platelets', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'ChIP-seq', 'Coronary Circulation', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Integrins', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'screening', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'working group']",NHLBI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,392349,84057270,0.07477552156467566
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9130902,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'user friendly software', 'web app', 'whole genome']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,430578,246330700,0.06994087872946188
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelomeningocele (MM), the most common type of spina bifida (SB) (>90% of cases), affects 1 in  2,500 live births in the United States and is the most severe subtype of neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival. Mexican Americans (MexA) have the highest prevalence rate in the US with Caucasians Americans (CauA) second. An estimated lifetime of medical care costs (up to 65 years of age) for an individual affected with MM is ~$806,000 (2007 dollars). Occurrence of MM represents a significant economic and public health burden. Genetic contribution to formation of NTDs is complex as is illustrated by the e 240 known mouse models. However, the majority of these mouse models have rostral NTDs while only a handful present with the SB phenotype indicating that SB is more genetically homogeneous. Genetic variation underlying susceptibility and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the development of human MM is largely unknown. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most cost-effective tool to discover all frequency of variations in the exome. We hypothesize that the genetic architecture of MM is comprised of novel/de novo genetic variants identifiable in the exomes of MM subjects by WES, unique variants present in genes known to associate with MM, and genetic variation in novel genes. This proposal utilizes WES to investigate the extent to which rare, novel or de novo variants play a role in human MM.  Our immediate objective is to characterize the full spectrum of allelic variations in genes and pathways unique to the exomes of MM subjects to reveal the genetic variability. We will use an enhanced WES protocol to interrogate genetic variations in the exomes of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects. Ethnic specific variations will be filtered using an exome variation database built from 1,547 MexA exomes of the T2D-GENES project and from 2,649 CauA exomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project to obtain novel variations. De novo variations will be determined by examining unaffected parents. Characterization of deleterious variants will be determined by functional prediction algorithms. To identify variants influencing MM susceptibility, we will perform logistic regression analysis and gene-based burden tests on genes and pathways according to the rare allele frequency. We will identify variants influencing MM susceptibility prioritized by effect sizes and predicted functional impacts. We will verify association of genes influencing MM susceptibility. Significance of variations in genes and pathways will also be evaluated by meta-analyses. We will replicate ten genes prioritized by occurrence of novel variants, effect sizes and functional impacts in an additional cohort of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects to verify their influence on MM susceptibility. Completion of the proposed project will define the role of novel/de novo variants to MM susceptibility and create an MM specific exome variants resource that can facilitate future research directions including translation to clinical diagnosis, prediction of outcome and designing treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelomeningocele (MM) is the most severe form of open neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival and affected individuals have lifelong disabilities. With approximately 1 in 2,500 live births in the United States affected each year, MM represents a huge public health problem as the estimated economic burden in medical care costs alone is~$806,000 in 2007 dollars for an affected individual up to age 65 years. Because little is known about the genetic variations that contribute to causality of MM, we propose to examine exomes of 500 MM subjects to identify unique variations in genes and pathways influencing MM susceptibility that can be used to facilitate future research and clinical care for improved diagnostics, outcome prediction and treatment. 1",Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map,9054141,R01HD073434,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Architecture', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Meningomyelocele', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mexican Americans', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'caucasian American', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,534436,135644722,0.09495838576893699
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases. This goal is directly relevant to the missions of NIH to improve the capability of disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.            ",Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants,9071997,R01CA213466,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical Research', 'Clofarabine', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exons', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spliced Genes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'mRNA Precursor', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'structural genomics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,576262,232986943,0.016866896758991643
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.            ",Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks,9101722,R01MH109907,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Comb animal structure', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prosencephalon', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIMH,J.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9177170,R01HL134015,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,740775,593605914,0.08119621187331078
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9110269,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'computerized data processing', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2016,747826,533302350,0.019981788944396277
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9114170,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2016,750000,178569161,0.05281627060486018
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9151409,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'protein expression', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'research study', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2016,759853,18270482,0.034784652990653454
"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.            ","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9132585,U01HG009086,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cost', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,854333,117374875,0.07866608476597935
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,9133462,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'small airways disease', 'study population', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,891352,327644200,0.04338751658725011
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9111957,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'standard of care', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,1277210,367414121,0.05891790700171259
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,9134491,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,2234652,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"Genome-wide Case-control Association Study of Pancreatic Cancer in Jews     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiologic studies have consistently found Jews to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared to non-Jewish whites. This excess risk is not accounted for by BRCA1/2 mutations or by other known risk factors. We therefore propose to examine in Jewish subjects the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations observed in the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort and Case-Control Consortium (PanScan) genome-wide association study (GWAS), to perform an exploratory GWAS to identify additional SNPs associated with pancreatic cancer in the Jewish population, and to assess genetic underpinning of the relationship between Jewish ancestry and pancreatic cancer. To do this, we will use GWAS data from PanScan and from the Johns Hopkins University study titled ""Validation and Fine-Scale Mapping of Pancreatic Cancer Susceptibility Loci."" In our study, Jewish subjects with be identified with a panel of genetic markers that correlate strongly with self-reported Jewish ancestry. Preliminary sample size calculations, based upon participants in the PanScan and Johns Hopkins University studies, give an estimate of around 500 Jewish cases and 300 unaffected Jewish controls. We will use the program Eigensoft (v.3.0) to conduct a principal component analysis that will genetically identify Jewish subjects among other racial/ethnic groups. We will validate these genetically identified Jews by using a subset of self-reported Jewish subjects in the Yale University, Johns Hopkins, and Memorial Sloan Kettering studies, all sub-studies in the PanScan and Johns Hopkins University studies. We will perform the SNP replication analysis, conduct the GWAS, and will assess genetic contribution using the program PLINK (v.1, 07): whole genome association analysis toolset. Logistic regression models will be used for each SNP, with pancreatic cancer as the outcome variable and each SNP as a predictor variable. Any association with P-value less than 0.05 will be considered significant for the candidate gene approach, and less than 10-6 for the GWAS approach. This will be the first study to determine a genetic basis, distinct from BRCA1/2 mutations, for the excess risk of pancreatic cancer in Jews. Results from this work will open paths to identify genetic interactions and will begin to approach the possibility of genetic screening for pancreatic cancer in the Jewish population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Jews have repeatedly been found to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer. However, this increased risk has not been adequately explained. We will validate previously identified significant variants and perform a genome-wide association study limited to Jewish individuals to find genetic variants associated with pancreatic cancer in this high-risk population.            ",Genome-wide Case-control Association Study of Pancreatic Cancer in Jews,8788231,F31CA177153,"['1q32.1', '5p15.33', '7q36', '9q34', 'Accounting', 'African American', 'Ashkenazim', 'BRCA1 Mutation', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 Mutation', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Variation', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Survival Rate', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'blood group', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'cohort', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human SHH protein', 'men', 'mortality', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,550947887,0.016061118932100337
"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8879958,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'seropositive', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2015,46443,593605914,0.04734771835159175
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,9120986,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,68720,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.                ",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,8804084,K99HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Indium', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Relative (related person)', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2015,99937,191864802,0.03187445617371134
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. The catalog contains information about SNP-trait/disease associations that are extracted from published genome-wide association studies.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ""missing heritability"" will require moving beyond the current ""one SNP at a time"" genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate's long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ""risk profile"" score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan - statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello - developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale - statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ""discovery"" phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples - the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate's career development. The CBRPM's mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders - central topics of the candidate's career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher. n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8916113,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2015,175392,551214295,-0.017229502742390743
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9117098,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'phenomenological models', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2015,194377,178569161,0.05281627060486018
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.                ",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8829521,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,236912,685608202,0.041684456794440536
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,9047616,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,249543,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits. Application of the proposed methods to applied datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of complex traits and enhance existing risk-prediction models of complex disease.",Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines,8894057,R01HG007508,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nuclear Family', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Bias', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Study models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'X inherited trait', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'methylation pattern', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,341249,507546965,0.07865916997827152
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1.             Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,8962812,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,352350,90710179,0.053249802225784446
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development. Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8906910,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'rare variant', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,371408,641965656,0.061845805015861274
"Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Cancer is a consequence of the accumulation of genetic alterations. Large whole-genome scale resequencing projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have been launched in an effort to comprehensively catalog the genomic mutations and epigenetic modifications that are associated with cancer. It is essential to identify cancer-causing genes and pathways to gain insight into the disease mechanisms and hence facilitate early diagnosis and optimal treatment. However, identifying cancer-causing genes and their functional pathways remains challenging due to the complex biological interactions and the heterogeneity of diseases. Genetic mutations in disease-causing genes can disturb signaling pathways that impact the expression of a set of genes performing certain biological functions. We refer to a set of such genes as a functional module. We hypothesize that driver mutations, that is, mutations that lead to cancer progression, are likely to affect common disease-associated functional modules, and the causal relationship between the mutations and the perturbed signals of the modules can be reconstructed from gene expression data and protein interaction data. In this project, we will develop a novel approach to infer disease-causing genes and networks by integrating information from multiple types of data including genomic variations, gene expression and protein interactions. We first dynamically identify disease-associated modules that consist of a set of interacting genes, then develop a Bayesian-based approach to infer causative genes from the disease-associated modules. Then, by developing a stochastic search based method, we can determine the paths connecting causative genes and gene modules. As a result, disease- related pathways are inferred from the paths. Furthermore, we will integrate those pathways with the human interactome to discover higher-level disease-associated networks. In addition, we will develop machine learning based classifiers to predict disease types and clinical outcomes utilizing the molecular signatures identified in this project, such as differentially expressed gene modules and causative genes. Our computational framework and classifiers will be made available to the research community via a webserver. The PI serves as the university bioinformatics program director and has extensive teaching and research experience. A goal of this project is also to provide scientific research training to students and o help students to gain biological insight through their involvement with the project. Students will learn practical scientific computing skills from the PI and develop their own computational approaches to solving specific biomedical problems under the guidance of the PI. Thus the project will serve as an effective learning-research model in bioinformatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and implement a novel framework to identify causative mutations and pathways and study cancer disease mechanisms by reconstructing signaling pathways. This will help to advance personalized medicine and lead to a greater understanding of cancer mechanisms, which can lay the foundation for improving early diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic targets.            ",Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks,8880075,R15GM114739,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Universities', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer framework', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'scientific computing', 'skills', 'treatment planning', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT LITTLE ROCK,R15,2015,373520,443854,0.04249925033785847
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.            ",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,8985084,R01HL128234,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Platelet Disorders', 'Blood Platelets', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'ChIP-seq', 'Coronary Circulation', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Integrins', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'working group']",NHLBI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,406469,84057270,0.07477552156467566
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts.

The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelomeningocele (MM), the most common type of spina bifida (SB) (>90% of cases), affects 1 in  2,500 live births in the United States and is the most severe subtype of neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival. Mexican Americans (MexA) have the highest prevalence rate in the US with Caucasians Americans (CauA) second. An estimated lifetime of medical care costs (up to 65 years of age) for an individual affected with MM is ~$806,000 (2007 dollars). Occurrence of MM represents a significant economic and public health burden. Genetic contribution to formation of NTDs is complex as is illustrated by the e 240 known mouse models. However, the majority of these mouse models have rostral NTDs while only a handful present with the SB phenotype indicating that SB is more genetically homogeneous. Genetic variation underlying susceptibility and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the development of human MM is largely unknown. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most cost-effective tool to discover all frequency of variations in the exome. We hypothesize that the genetic architecture of MM is comprised of novel/de novo genetic variants identifiable in the exomes of MM subjects by WES, unique variants present in genes known to associate with MM, and genetic variation in novel genes. This proposal utilizes WES to investigate the extent to which rare, novel or de novo variants play a role in human MM.  Our immediate objective is to characterize the full spectrum of allelic variations in genes and pathways unique to the exomes of MM subjects to reveal the genetic variability. We will use an enhanced WES protocol to interrogate genetic variations in the exomes of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects. Ethnic specific variations will be filtered using an exome variation database built from 1,547 MexA exomes of the T2D-GENES project and from 2,649 CauA exomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project to obtain novel variations. De novo variations will be determined by examining unaffected parents. Characterization of deleterious variants will be determined by functional prediction algorithms. To identify variants influencing MM susceptibility, we will perform logistic regression analysis and gene-based burden tests on genes and pathways according to the rare allele frequency. We will identify variants influencing MM susceptibility prioritized by effect sizes and predicted functional impacts. We will verify association of genes influencing MM susceptibility. Significance of variations in genes and pathways will also be evaluated by meta-analyses. We will replicate ten genes prioritized by occurrence of novel variants, effect sizes and functional impacts in an additional cohort of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects to verify their influence on MM susceptibility. Completion of the proposed project will define the role of novel/de novo variants to MM susceptibility and create an MM specific exome variants resource that can facilitate future research directions including translation to clinical diagnosis, prediction of outcome and designing treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelomeningocele (MM) is the most severe form of open neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival and affected individuals have lifelong disabilities. With approximately 1 in 2,500 live births in the United States affected each year, MM represents a huge public health problem as the estimated economic burden in medical care costs alone is~$806,000 in 2007 dollars for an affected individual up to age 65 years. Because little is known about the genetic variations that contribute to causality of MM, we propose to examine exomes of 500 MM subjects to identify unique variations in genes and pathways influencing MM susceptibility that can be used to facilitate future research and clinical care for improved diagnostics, outcome prediction and treatment. 1",Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map,8843501,R01HD073434,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Meningomyelocele', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mexican Americans', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'caucasian American', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,479414,135644722,0.09495838576893699
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.            ","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",8945859,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2015,487902,246330700,0.06994087872946188
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment. In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.            ",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8817912,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Family member', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Videokeratographies', 'Vision', 'base', 'bead chip', 'cardiovascular health', 'cholesterol control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'therapy design/development', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,661520,90419233,0.08858908204754515
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),8929310,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'phenomenological models', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2015,750000,178569161,0.05281627060486018
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8919725,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,750001,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.            ",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,8933744,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'computerized data processing', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2015,751729,533302350,0.019981788944396277
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.            ",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,8965166,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,911563,327644200,0.04338751658725011
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8892240,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,1254784,367414121,0.05891790700171259
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.

"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8717915,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2014,46078,593605914,0.04734771835159175
"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3).

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8724540,U01HG006379,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2014,164026,276703803,0.047433250570253674
"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8726983,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2014,175392,551214295,-0.017229502742390743

The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. The catalog contains information about SNP-trait/disease associations that are extracted from published genome-wide association studies.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk. This project is focused on analysis of the relationship between genetic variation and common disease with the goal of identifying new therapeutic opportunities.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.             Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelomeningocele (MM), the most common type of spina bifida (SB) (>90% of cases), affects 1 in  2,500 live births in the United States and is the most severe subtype of neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival. Mexican Americans (MexA) have the highest prevalence rate in the US with Caucasians Americans (CauA) second. An estimated lifetime of medical care costs (up to 65 years of age) for an individual affected with MM is ~$806,000 (2007 dollars). Occurrence of MM represents a significant economic and public health burden. Genetic contribution to formation of NTDs is complex as is illustrated by the e 240 known mouse models. However, the majority of these mouse models have rostral NTDs while only a handful present with the SB phenotype indicating that SB is more genetically homogeneous. Genetic variation underlying susceptibility and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the development of human MM is largely unknown. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most cost-effective tool to discover all frequency of variations in the exome. We hypothesize that the genetic architecture of MM is comprised of novel/de novo genetic variants identifiable in the exomes of MM subjects by WES, unique variants present in genes known to associate with MM, and genetic variation in novel genes. This proposal utilizes WES to investigate the extent to which rare, novel or de novo variants play a role in human MM.  Our immediate objective is to characterize the full spectrum of allelic variations in genes and pathways unique to the exomes of MM subjects to reveal the genetic variability. We will use an enhanced WES protocol to interrogate genetic variations in the exomes of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects. Ethnic specific variations will be filtered using an exome variation database built from 1,547 MexA exomes of the T2D-GENES project and from 2,649 CauA exomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project to obtain novel variations. De novo variations will be determined by examining unaffected parents. Characterization of deleterious variants will be determined by functional prediction algorithms. To identify variants influencing MM susceptibility, we will perform logistic regression analysis and gene-based burden tests on genes and pathways according to the rare allele frequency. We will identify variants influencing MM susceptibility prioritized by effect sizes and predicted functional impacts. We will verify association of genes influencing MM susceptibility. Significance of variations in genes and pathways will also be evaluated by meta-analyses. We will replicate ten genes prioritized by occurrence of novel variants, effect sizes and functional impacts in an additional cohort of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects to verify their influence on MM susceptibility. Completion of the proposed project will define the role of novel/de novo variants to MM susceptibility and create an MM specific exome variants resource that can facilitate future research directions including translation to clinical diagnosis, prediction of outcome and designing treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelomeningocele (MM) is the most severe form of open neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival and affected individuals have lifelong disabilities. With approximately 1 in 2,500 live births in the United States affected each year, MM represents a huge public health problem as the estimated economic burden in medical care costs alone is~$806,000 in 2007 dollars for an affected individual up to age 65 years. Because little is known about the genetic variations that contribute to causality of MM, we propose to examine exomes of 500 MM subjects to identify unique variations in genes and pathways influencing MM susceptibility that can be used to facilitate future research and clinical care for improved diagnostics, outcome prediction and treatment. 1                ",Creating a Myelomeningocele Exome Variant Map,8631540,R01HD073434,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Meningomyelocele', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mexican Americans', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'base', 'caucasian American', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,488554,135644722,0.09495838576893699
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8656359,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,492794,30434536,0.055335771777808324
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),8698507,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2014,750000,178569161,0.05281627060486018
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.                ",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8786636,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,1308724,367414121,0.05891790700171259
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8738706,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Professional counselor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,2351999,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.         Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"Genome-wide Case-control Association Study of Pancreatic Cancer in Jews     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiologic studies have consistently found Jews to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared to non-Jewish whites. This excess risk is not accounted for by BRCA1/2 mutations or by other known risk factors. We therefore propose to examine in Jewish subjects the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations observed in the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort and Case-Control Consortium (PanScan) genome-wide association study (GWAS), to perform an exploratory GWAS to identify additional SNPs associated with pancreatic cancer in the Jewish population, and to assess genetic underpinning of the relationship between Jewish ancestry and pancreatic cancer. To do this, we will use GWAS data from PanScan and from the Johns Hopkins University study titled ""Validation and Fine-Scale Mapping of Pancreatic Cancer Susceptibility Loci."" In our study, Jewish subjects with be identified with a panel of genetic markers that correlate strongly with self-reported Jewish ancestry. Preliminary sample size calculations, based upon participants in the PanScan and Johns Hopkins University studies, give an estimate of around 500 Jewish cases and 300 unaffected Jewish controls. We will use the program Eigensoft (v.3.0) to conduct a principal component analysis that will genetically identify Jewish subjects among other racial/ethnic groups. We will validate these genetically identified Jews by using a subset of self-reported Jewish subjects in the Yale University, Johns Hopkins, and Memorial Sloan Kettering studies, all sub-studies in the PanScan and Johns Hopkins University studies. We will perform the SNP replication analysis, conduct the GWAS, and will assess genetic contribution using the program PLINK (v.1, 07): whole genome association analysis toolset. Logistic regression models will be used for each SNP, with pancreatic cancer as the outcome variable and each SNP as a predictor variable. Any association with P-value less than 0.05 will be considered significant for the candidate gene approach, and less than 10-6 for the GWAS approach. This will be the first study to determine a genetic basis, distinct from BRCA1/2 mutations, for the excess risk of pancreatic cancer in Jews. Results from this work will open paths to identify genetic interactions and will begin to approach the possibility of genetic screening for pancreatic cancer in the Jewish population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Jews have repeatedly been found to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer. However, this increased risk has not been adequately explained. We will validate previously identified significant variants and perform a genome-wide association study limited to Jewish individuals to find genetic variants associated with pancreatic cancer in this high-risk population.            ",Genome-wide Case-control Association Study of Pancreatic Cancer in Jews,8527018,F31CA177153,"['1q32.1', '5p15.33', '7q36', '9q34', 'Accounting', 'African American', 'Ashkenazim', 'BRCA1 Mutation', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 Mutation', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Variation', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Survival Rate', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'blood group', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'cohort', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human SHH protein', 'men', 'mortality', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,42232,550947887,0.016061118932100337
"A new approach to identify rare genetic variants influencing melanoma risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully implicated common SNPs in the etiology of complex traits. Most variants identified so far confer relatively small increments in risk (1.1-1.5-fold), and explain oly a small proportion of familial clustering. Recent studies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due to dysfunctional variants with a wide spectrum of allele frequencies. So far, rare variants studies have been limited to a handful of phenotypes and genes, but the advancement of sequencing technologies should lead to widespread association studies of candidate genes and genomes. If rare variants have larger effects than common variants, this should aid in their detection. Also their identification should have a greater impact on risk assessment, disease prevention and treatment. However, the analysis of rare variants is challenging since methods used for common variants are underpowered. Previously, we used data from mutation screening of breast cancer patients and controls to demonstrate the ability to detect evidence of pathogenicity from both truncating and splice junction variants and rare missense substitutions. The method involves stratifying rare missense substitutions observed in cases and/or in controls into a series of grades ordered from least to most likely to be evolutionarily deleterious, followed by a logistic regression trend test to compare the frequency distributions of the grades of variants in cases versus controls. The original model was developed to assess the pathogenicity of missense substitutions in breast cancer-related genes. Here we propose to test the efficiency of our analysis strategy to cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). To identify novel risk alleles, we will mutation screen the strongest candidate genes of the pigmentation pathway in over 1,300 cases and 1,300 matched controls from 10 European countries enrolled in the EPIC cohort. CMM provides a unique model for studies of gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions in the development of multifactorial diseases, since relationships between the major environmental factor (exposure to solar UV radiation) and known susceptibility genes are reasonably well understood. High-risk mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 are carried by about 20-25% of melanoma-prone families. In contrast, some missense substitutions in the pigmentation gene MC1R have been proven to be modest-risk or intermediate-risk susceptibility alleles, and also to increase the penetrance of CDKN2A mutations. Finally, two recent GWAS identified low- penetrance SNPs in MC1R or in genes of the same pathway. Associated SNPs will account for no more than 12% of the Familial Relative Risk. Thus, the majority of the genetic susceptibility to CMM remains to be explained. After validation of our method on strong candidates, massive parallel sequencing of genes of entire biochemical pathways is envisaged to generate a comprehensive picture of the risk-frequency spectrum for pathogenic sequence variants involved in susceptibility to melanoma.          Malignant melanoma is a rare tumor of melanocytes that, because of its aggressive nature, causes the majority of deaths related to skin cancer. Since the mid-20th century, melanoma has become an important health problem in fair-skinned populations worldwide, since its incidence has climbed faster than any other type of malignancy. The goal of this study is the identification of new melanoma susceptibility genes and the characterization of the pathogenic sequence variants associated with increased risk of developing melanoma. Identification of susceptible individuals may aid in increasing sun protection and early detection of melanocytic tumors at the precancerous stage of the disease, altering attitudes toward sunlight and suntans, and protecting the skin from UV damage in populations at risk.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. The catalog contains information about SNP-trait/disease associations that are extracted from published genome-wide association studies. A well-curated catalog of GWAS allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results and provides a useful resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes.            ",Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining,8549925,U01HG006894,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Paper', 'Productivity', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'base', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2013,54233,324592664,0.05722366432337061
"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8729073,U01HG006379,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2013,168421,276703803,0.047433250570253674
"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8535152,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2013,175392,551214295,-0.017229502742390743
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8459567,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,287765,507546965,0.024050941590749428
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8528722,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,305913,117374875,0.058755618898248964
"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.          The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8514000,R01EY022300,"['Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,307800,90710179,0.014928053552258215
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.            ",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8528145,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,382699,641965656,0.061845805015861274
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8251157,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,477069,30434536,0.055335771777808324
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8520368,U01HG006379,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2013,951710,276703803,0.047433250570253674
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8574128,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Professional counselor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,1400000,560644462,0.0874767116964846
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.         Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology.

"A new approach to identify rare genetic variants influencing melanoma risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully implicated common SNPs in the etiology of complex traits. Most variants identified so far confer relatively small increments in risk (1.1-1.5-fold), and explain oly a small proportion of familial clustering. Recent studies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due to dysfunctional variants with a wide spectrum of allele frequencies. So far, rare variants studies have been limited to a handful of phenotypes and genes, but the advancement of sequencing technologies should lead to widespread association studies of candidate genes and genomes. If rare variants have larger effects than common variants, this should aid in their detection. Also their identification should have a greater impact on risk assessment, disease prevention and treatment. However, the analysis of rare variants is challenging since methods used for common variants are underpowered. Previously, we used data from mutation screening of breast cancer patients and controls to demonstrate the ability to detect evidence of pathogenicity from both truncating and splice junction variants and rare missense substitutions. The method involves stratifying rare missense substitutions observed in cases and/or in controls into a series of grades ordered from least to most likely to be evolutionarily deleterious, followed by a logistic regression trend test to compare the frequency distributions of the grades of variants in cases versus controls. The original model was developed to assess the pathogenicity of missense substitutions in breast cancer-related genes. Here we propose to test the efficiency of our analysis strategy to cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). To identify novel risk alleles, we will mutation screen the strongest candidate genes of the pigmentation pathway in over 1,300 cases and 1,300 matched controls from 10 European countries enrolled in the EPIC cohort. CMM provides a unique model for studies of gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions in the development of multifactorial diseases, since relationships between the major environmental factor (exposure to solar UV radiation) and known susceptibility genes are reasonably well understood. High-risk mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 are carried by about 20-25% of melanoma-prone families. In contrast, some missense substitutions in the pigmentation gene MC1R have been proven to be modest-risk or intermediate-risk susceptibility alleles, and also to increase the penetrance of CDKN2A mutations. Finally, two recent GWAS identified low- penetrance SNPs in MC1R or in genes of the same pathway. Associated SNPs will account for no more than 12% of the Familial Relative Risk. Thus, the majority of the genetic susceptibility to CMM remains to be explained. After validation of our method on strong candidates, massive parallel sequencing of genes of entire biochemical pathways is envisaged to generate a comprehensive picture of the risk-frequency spectrum for pathogenic sequence variants involved in susceptibility to melanoma.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malignant melanoma is a rare tumor of melanocytes that, because of its aggressive nature, causes the majority of deaths related to skin cancer. Since the mid-20th century, melanoma has become an important health problem in fair-skinned populations worldwide, since its incidence has climbed faster than any other type of malignancy. The goal of this study is the identification of new melanoma susceptibility genes and the characterization of the pathogenic sequence variants associated with increased risk of developing melanoma. Identification of susceptible individuals may aid in increasing sun protection and early detection of melanocytic tumors at the precancerous stage of the disease, altering attitudes toward sunlight and suntans, and protecting the skin from UV damage in populations at risk.              Malignant melanoma is a rare tumor of melanocytes that, because of its aggressive nature, causes the majority of deaths related to skin cancer.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8540536,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2012,164868,90419233,0.09187033107835388
"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8308347,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2012,175392,551214295,-0.017229502742390743
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics. This award will help the candidate to establish an independent research career, position herself on the front of these new advances, and bring the lessons learned to the field of child psychiatry.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8246510,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,306133,507546965,0.024050941590749428
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health. n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8197396,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2012,306196,10786285,0.02777470365045194
"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                  The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8264613,R01EY022300,"['Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,322000,90710179,-0.0060871046816315085
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8326646,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,332514,117374875,0.058755618898248964
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells. n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8258763,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,438425,685608202,0.04770667098893342
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8215705,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2012,672532,90419233,0.09187033107835388
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8242887,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2012,769079,175892898,0.06558243457629866
"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8319363,U01HG006379,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2012,773313,276703803,0.047433250570253674
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.

"Energy balance and nutrigenetic analysis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Energy balance and nutrigenetic analyses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma In the U.S, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in adults with >60,000 cases newly diagnosed each year. A few studies have identified some components of energy-balance: diet, exercise and obesity that are associated with NHL risk. Laboratory data show that these factors also can affect immune and inflammatory processes that may influence lymphomagenesis. Genetic susceptibility for NHL and NHL subtypes has been identified in biologically plausible pathways including immune function, inflammation, oxidative processes and in DNA repair and integrity. However, no comprehensive analyses have been conducted that integrate energy-balance factors, genetics and NHL risk. Our innovative analyses will leverage epidemiologic and genetic data already collected during in-person interviews in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) analyze diet, anthropometric and exercise data to determine associations with risk of NHL and NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) analyze gene-environment interactions to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in dietary response and metabolism genes, and in inflammation and immune function genes modify the association between factors in Aim 1 and NHL risk. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding and effect modification will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk and to explore differential effects by subgroups including NHL subtypes. Energy-adjusted methods and statistical methods to assess misreporting of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data also will be used for analyses of nutrient data. The studys major strengths are: 1) a rich epidemiologic dataset that includes already collected exercise, anthropometrics and dietary history data collected using a validated and calibrated FFQ with frequency and portion size for specific foods, supplement use, cooking methods and macro and micronutrients computed using a relational food composition database; 2) demographic and other data available to evaluate confounding and effect modification and; 3) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the nutrigenetics of NHL. Results from the comprehensive analyses within our large well-defined study population will provide insight into modifiable dietary-related risk factors and nutrigenetics associated with NHL and common NHL subtypes that can help clarify the role of bioactive foods in lymphomagenesis. The information from our work also will be useful to help generate hypotheses for future research, to direct functional studies, to help identify key biologic pathways that alter susceptibility, and will be directly applicable to prevention and intervention programs to reduce NHL incidence. In addition, future pooled analyses of these and related data are planned within the InterLymph Consortium to confirm findings and to increase power and sample size for analyses by rare NHL subtypes, and for low-frequency exposures that cannot be investigated adequately in individual studies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions. There is growing evidence that the modifiable lifestyle factors of diet, physical activity and obesity are associated with NHL risk and that these factors act in genetic pathways that also have been associated with NHL risk. Clarifying the role that these modifiable factors play in risk of NHL and NHL subtypes will improve our understanding of NHL development, help to generate new hypotheses for future research and will be directly applicable to prevention, intervention and screening programs with a goal to reduce NHL incidence.          Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and  few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some  rare genetic conditions.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative/Relevance We will develop computational tools for analyzing complex associations between images, genotype and clinical phenotype. The tools will be user-friendly and freely available, and will potentially facilitate accurate early diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders such as Alzheimer's.             n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8165447,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2011,175392,551214295,-0.01855197815982907
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.            The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology.

"Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this project are to develop novel statistical methods and computer packages for cancer classification and survival analysis using high-dimensional gene expression data and clinical measurements. For studying the layered complexity of cancer, gene expression prowling using micro arrays and statistical analysis offers a powerful tool as it allows analysis of gene expression patterns in a genome-wide scale. As expression pro ling technologies mature and more and more massive data are being generated, the identification of statistically and biologically significant patterns from high- dimensional and noisy data sets is increasingly becoming a major challenge. There is an urgent need to develop statistical methods that can deal with such high-dimensional problems in linking the clinical outcomes and gene expression pro les, for better diagnosis of disease status, better prescription of treatment, and better survival prediction in cancer. In this project, we will use the basic principles of cancer genetics to guide our efforts in developing novel methods and models for analyzing data from cancer expression prowling studies. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop bridge penalized method for variable selection and estimation for high-dimensional models that have important applications in gene expression prowling studies of cancer. (2) Develop group-bridge penalized method for incorporating biological pathways into the analysis of gene expression data. (3) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for tumor classification and biomarker selection using gene expression data, with emphasis on regularized logistic regression and semi-parametric ROC classification methods for improved sensitivity and specificity, while adjusting for other clinical covariates and risk factors. (4) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for correlating survival with gene expression data, while adjusting for other clinical measurements and risk factors. Important models to consider include the linear and partially linear Cox proportional hazards models and the linear and partially linear accelerated failure time models. (5) Implement the proposed methods in well documented R packages and C programs; evaluate these methods by extensive computer simulation studies and by use of publicly available data sets; and apply them to two expression prowling studies of lymphoma and head and neck cancers. The development of the proposed statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in estimating the relationship between cancer clinical outcomes and genomic data will contribute to better understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction, which in turn, can potentially have important impact on public health.             n/a",Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer,8011087,R01CA120988,"['Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Iowa', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Prowl', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer microarray', 'college', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2011,279041,193405667,0.011346710438066579
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8012280,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2011,306343,10786285,0.028677491536272175
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8042010,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,336864,117374875,0.058755618898248964
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,460136,685608202,0.052562867971587005
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8054816,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,513100,30434536,0.055335771777808324
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.",Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer,8059620,R01CA131324,"['African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Control Groups', 'County', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Carcinogens', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Histologic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant Squamous Cell Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Mutagens', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Squamous Cell', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'adduct', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'plasmid DNA', 'population based', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2011,594620,175892898,0.039353826416904984
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8054297,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2011,669490,175892898,0.06558243457629866
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8018102,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,672532,90419233,0.09187033107835388
"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8193561,U01HG006379,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2011,788498,276703803,0.047433250570253674
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease. We propose to study the complex interplay of environmental, immunological and genetic factors to discover molecular signatures with a potential to advance clinical diagnosis and therapy at or before the onset of T1D.           The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years.

"Role of the MHC Class II tranactivator gene in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator gene (MHC2TA) on chromosome 16p13has recently emerged as the single most important transcription factor for regulation of genes required for class II MHC-restricted antigen presentation. This study will test the hypothesis that genetic variation inMHC2TA is associated with susceptibility to SLE and RA, and that this variation may interact with one or more SLE-associated and RA-associated MHC class II alleles to influence disease risk and secondary phenotypes. The broad long-term objectives are to examine the potential role of MHC2TA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and secondary phenotypes in conjunction with known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk haplotypes. The specific aims are to genotype over thirty well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MHC2TA gene region will be genotyped in 1,000 Caucasian RA families and 1,000 Caucasian SLE families to identify specific alleles, genotypes and haplotypes associated with RA and SLE risk. Family-based association tests, conditional linkage disequilibrium approaches and conditional logistic regression modeling will be performed to identify potential genetic interactions and disease risk modifying effects within this genomic region. Due to the strong relationship of lupus nephritis (LN) to SLE morbidity and mortality, LN will be studied as an important secondary outcome in the SLE families. Associations with specific RA phenotypes (rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positivity, and erosive disease) in the RA families will also be examined. One of the major strengths of this study is the family-based research design, which will reduce the problem of population stratification often present in genetic case-control studies. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases with a tremendous societal and economic burden. The genetic contribution of the MHC class II gene region is known to be substantial. A better understanding of variation within the MHC class II transactivator gene and how it influences risk and/or phenotypic expression may help lead to improved methods of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.           n/a",Role of the MHC Class II tranactivator gene in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis,7776829,F31AI075609,"['Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'MHC Class II Genes', 'MHC class II transactivator protein', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Research Design', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disorder risk', 'gene interaction', 'genetic pedigree', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'secondary outcome', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2010,19596,148186688,0.06437895007936896
"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism.

"Energy balance and nutrigenetic analysis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Energy balance and nutrigenetic analyses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma In the U.S, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematopoietic cancer in adults with >60,000 cases newly diagnosed each year. A few studies have identified some components of energy-balance: diet, exercise and obesity that are associated with NHL risk. Laboratory data show that these factors also can affect immune and inflammatory processes that may influence lymphomagenesis. Genetic susceptibility for NHL and NHL subtypes has been identified in biologically plausible pathways including immune function, inflammation, oxidative processes and in DNA repair and integrity. However, no comprehensive analyses have been conducted that integrate energy-balance factors, genetics and NHL risk. Our innovative analyses will leverage epidemiologic and genetic data already collected during in-person interviews in our large population-based case-control NHL study (2055 cases, 2081 controls) to: Aim 1) analyze diet, anthropometric and exercise data to determine associations with risk of NHL and NHL subtypes and; Aim 2) analyze gene-environment interactions to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in dietary response and metabolism genes, and in inflammation and immune function genes modify the association between factors in Aim 1 and NHL risk. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding and effect modification will be used to obtain odds ratios as estimates of relative risk and to explore differential effects by subgroups including NHL subtypes. Energy-adjusted methods and statistical methods to assess misreporting of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data also will be used for analyses of nutrient data. The studys major strengths are: 1) a rich epidemiologic dataset that includes already collected exercise, anthropometrics and dietary history data collected using a validated and calibrated FFQ with frequency and portion size for specific foods, supplement use, cooking methods and macro and micronutrients computed using a relational food composition database; 2) demographic and other data available to evaluate confounding and effect modification and; 3) DNA already analyzed for SNPs in 146 genes in biologic pathways that may be relevant to the nutrigenetics of NHL. Results from the comprehensive analyses within our large well-defined study population will provide insight into modifiable dietary-related risk factors and nutrigenetics associated with NHL and common NHL subtypes that can help clarify the role of bioactive foods in lymphomagenesis. The information from our work also will be useful to help generate hypotheses for future research, to direct functional studies, to help identify key biologic pathways that alter susceptibility, and will be directly applicable to prevention and intervention programs to reduce NHL incidence. In addition, future pooled analyses of these and related data are planned within the InterLymph Consortium to confirm findings and to increase power and sample size for analyses by rare NHL subtypes, and for low-frequency exposures that cannot be investigated adequately in individual studies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some rare genetic conditions. There is growing evidence that the modifiable lifestyle factors of diet, physical activity and obesity are associated with NHL risk and that these factors act in genetic pathways that also have been associated with NHL risk. Clarifying the role that these modifiable factors play in risk of NHL and NHL subtypes will improve our understanding of NHL development, help to generate new hypotheses for future research and will be directly applicable to prevention, intervention and screening programs with a goal to reduce NHL incidence.          Project Narrative Incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has nearly doubled over the past 40 years and  few risk factors have been established other than those associated with severe immunosuppression and some  rare genetic conditions.

"Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this project are to develop novel statistical methods and computer packages for cancer classification and survival analysis using high-dimensional gene expression data and clinical measurements. For studying the layered complexity of cancer, gene expression prowling using micro arrays and statistical analysis offers a powerful tool as it allows analysis of gene expression patterns in a genome-wide scale. As expression pro ling technologies mature and more and more massive data are being generated, the identification of statistically and biologically significant patterns from high- dimensional and noisy data sets is increasingly becoming a major challenge. There is an urgent need to develop statistical methods that can deal with such high-dimensional problems in linking the clinical outcomes and gene expression pro les, for better diagnosis of disease status, better prescription of treatment, and better survival prediction in cancer. In this project, we will use the basic principles of cancer genetics to guide our efforts in developing novel methods and models for analyzing data from cancer expression prowling studies. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop bridge penalized method for variable selection and estimation for high-dimensional models that have important applications in gene expression prowling studies of cancer. (2) Develop group-bridge penalized method for incorporating biological pathways into the analysis of gene expression data. (3) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for tumor classification and biomarker selection using gene expression data, with emphasis on regularized logistic regression and semi-parametric ROC classification methods for improved sensitivity and specificity, while adjusting for other clinical covariates and risk factors. (4) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for correlating survival with gene expression data, while adjusting for other clinical measurements and risk factors. Important models to consider include the linear and partially linear Cox proportional hazards models and the linear and partially linear accelerated failure time models. (5) Implement the proposed methods in well documented R packages and C programs; evaluate these methods by extensive computer simulation studies and by use of publicly available data sets; and apply them to two expression prowling studies of lymphoma and head and neck cancers. The development of the proposed statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in estimating the relationship between cancer clinical outcomes and genomic data will contribute to better understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction, which in turn, can potentially have important impact on public health.             Project Narrative  The development of the proposed statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in  estimating the relationship between cancer clinical outcomes and genomic data will contribute to better  understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction, which in  turn, can potentially have important impact on public health.",Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer,7744698,R01CA120988,"['Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Iowa', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Property', 'Prowl', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer microarray', 'college', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2010,287408,193405667,0.005251753590635134
"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7930715,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,288566,507546965,0.06626036218743504
"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,7843531,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,315601,507546965,0.029201228117498108
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7713981,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2010,319254,10786285,0.028677491536272175
"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders. All of the binding motifs, potential target genes, related SNPs and networks will be catalogued in the on-line resource PAZAR, a public database of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation (http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/index.pl), and the NIH-funded Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) (http://www.nursa.org/). Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. The recent sequencing of the human genome has allowed us to identify new genes associated with these diseases at an ever increasing rate. In this study we apply the latest high throughput technology to help identify variations in the genetic sequence that might be related to those (and other) diseases by examining the regulatory regions of genes and the proteins that bind those regions. Our work will help bring us closer to an era of personalized medicine in which prevention, diagnosis and treatment are tailored to the individual patient, making them more effective and less costly.           Project Narrative Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,467448,685608202,0.052562867971587005
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.          Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,7780356,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,680924,90419233,0.09187033107835388
"The Mitochondrial Genome and Ovarian Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality in women in the US but little is known of its etiology. Mitochondria participate in a number of essential functions in the cancer cell. The mitochondrial genome consists of a circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 16.5 kilobases and approximately 1500 nuclear mitochondrial genes. Germline and somatic mitochondrial genome variants and mutations have been identified in a number of different cancers. However, very few studies have investigated the mitochondrial genome in EOC. We have performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and found a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associations at the significance level (p<10-4 but >10-8) in genes showing significant associations in oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis pathways, where the mitochondria plays a key role. The common element of the central role of mitochondria in the three pathways showing significant associations provides evidence of cross-talk between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, which warrants further investigation. We previously identified associations with ovarian cancer risk in apoptosis-related and EMT-related genes. Taken together, these results prompted this study, the GOAL of which is to more comprehensively investigate the contribution of mitochondrial genome variation to ovarian cancer risk. Nuclear mitochondrial gene variation, mtDNA haplotype analysis and correlative somatic mtDNA studies will be performed. These studies will enable us to fully evaluate the HYPOTHESIS that inherited variation in the mitochondrial genome as well as the nuclear genome should be considered as factors for risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. The specific aims are: 1) Stage 1 - To investigate SNPs in nuclear mitochondrial-related and mtDNA genes. 2) Stage 2 - To validate the top hits in nuclear mitochondrial-related genes and mtDNA genes in an independent case-control collection 3) To identify mtDNA mutations and variants in EOC. This study is novel as we are investigating both nuclear and mitochondrial variation as risk factors for ovarian cancer. There are few current studies on mitochondria and ovarian cancer. The results of this study will contribute significantly to our broader efforts to elucidate the genetic basis of ovarian cancer and unravel the complexities of this lethal disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality in women in the US but little is known of the genetic basis of this disease. Mitochondria participate in a number of essential functions in the cell including energy production, protein and amino acid synthesis and programmed cell death (apoptosis). The mitochondrial genome consists of a circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 16.5 kilobases which codes for 37 genes. There are also approximately 1500 mitochondrial genes in the nuclear DNA, involved in a myriad of essential cellular functions such as signaling, cell growth and differentiation and apoptosis. Germline and somatic mitochondrial genome variants and mutations have been identified in a number of different cancers. However, very few studies have investigated the mitochondrial genome in EOC. We have previously performed a study looking at genetic variants around the whole genome in women with ovarian cancer compared to those who do not have the disease. Some of the most significant associations with ovarian cancer are in mitochondria-related genes. Furthermore we have previously looked at some genes related to the mitochondria and found some associations with ovarian cancer. The GOAL of the proposed study is to more comprehensively investigate mitochondrial genome variation in ovarian cancer. We will look both in the germline and tumor DNA. Nuclear mitochondrial gene variation, mtDNA haplotype analysis and correlative somatic mtDNA studies will be performed. These studies will enable us to fully evaluate the HYPOTHESIS that inherited variation in the mitochondrial genome as well as the nuclear genome should be considered as factors for risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. We have the following specific aims: 1) Stage 1 - To investigate SNPs in nuclear mitochondrial-related and mtDNA genes Approach: We will look at the results of the nuclear mitochondrial-related and mtDNA genes from the oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, protein synthesis and apoptosis pathways. Then for those genes that are significantly associated with ovarian cancer we will expand the coverage on genes in our chosen pathways in a study population of 2000 EOC cases and 2000 controls. Additional mtDNA SNPs will be included to ensure identification of the most common mtDNA haplogroups. We will use statistical analysis to look for SNP associations within major histologic subtypes and tumor characteristics. 2) Stage 2 - To validate the top hits in nuclear mitochondrial-related genes and mtDNA genes in an independent case-control collection Approach: We will validate the SNPs showing the most statistically significant associations with ovarian cancer (approximately 40 SNPs) in a collection of up to 10000 ovarian cancer cases and 10000 frequency matched controls from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Furthermore we will include mtDNA SNPs that define the most common mtDNA haplogroups. We will then use logistic regression to investigate the association of mtDNA haplogroups and histologic subtype and perform exploratory gene-environment interactions with non-genetic risk factors. 3) To identify mtDNA mutations and variants in EOC Approach: We will undertake mtDNA sequencing in ovarian tumor tissue in a subset of 400 ovarian cancer cases from the above panel. Sequencing will be performed using the Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0. Variants and mutations will be investigated in germline DNA of the same individual . We will investigate if particular mtDNA haplotypes are correlated with somatic variants or mutations in ovarian tumor tissue or particular variants are associated with tumor-specific characteristics. In this unique and powerful study we will investigate the impact of variation in the mitochondrial genome and variation of the nuclear genome on ovarian cancer risk. The preliminary data for this study comes from two ovarian cancer GWASes in over 8000 individuals which provides an immense resource upon which to build this study so as to make strides in ovarian cancer genetic research. The epidemiologic and genotype datasets are readily available, and are currently housed at the Moffitt Cancer Center which proves the feasibility of the proposed research. The blood DNAs and tumor specimens/blocks are also readily available for this study. The proposed work is scientifically sound, highly significant and novel. Our research team is highly skilled and has been working together successfully for many years in ovarian cancer SNP association studies as is evidenced by our joint publications and funding record. We will address several priorities established by the National Cancer Institute-convened Gynecologic Cancers Progress Review Group including (1) application of novel study designs to elucidate the genomics of ovarian cancer, and (2) systematic screening of germline genetic targets with translational impact. Finally, this study will address a number of the questions on the role of mitochondria in cancer that were posed in the program announcement (PA-08-143).             Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality in women in the US but little is  known of the genetic basis of this disease.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7799290,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2010,1196434,175892898,0.06558243457629866
"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD.",International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder,7911781,R01MH085542,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Europe', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Predisposition', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Sweden', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disability burden', 'early onset disorder', 'economic cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genotyping technology', 'instrument', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'success', 'treatment as usual', 'validation studies']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2010,2101331,551214295,0.07958025778636371
"Role of the MHC Class II tranactivator gene in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator gene (MHC2TA) on chromosome 16p13has recently emerged as the single most important transcription factor for regulation of genes required for class II MHC-restricted antigen presentation. This study will test the hypothesis that genetic variation inMHC2TA is associated with susceptibility to SLE and RA, and that this variation may interact with one or more SLE-associated and RA-associated MHC class II alleles to influence disease risk and secondary phenotypes. The broad long-term objectives are to examine the potential role of MHC2TA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and secondary phenotypes in conjunction with known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk haplotypes. The specific aims are to genotype over thirty well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MHC2TA gene region will be genotyped in 1,000 Caucasian RA families and 1,000 Caucasian SLE families to identify specific alleles, genotypes and haplotypes associated with RA and SLE risk. Family-based association tests, conditional linkage disequilibrium approaches and conditional logistic regression modeling will be performed to identify potential genetic interactions and disease risk modifying effects within this genomic region. Due to the strong relationship of lupus nephritis (LN) to SLE morbidity and mortality, LN will be studied as an important secondary outcome in the SLE families. Associations with specific RA phenotypes (rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positivity, and erosive disease) in the RA families will also be examined. One of the major strengths of this study is the family-based research design, which will reduce the problem of population stratification often present in genetic case-control studies. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases with a tremendous societal and economic burden. The genetic contribution of the MHC class II gene region is known to be substantial. A better understanding of variation within the MHC class II transactivator gene and how it influences risk and/or phenotypic expression may help lead to improved methods of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.           n/a",Role of the MHC Class II tranactivator gene in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis,7599010,F31AI075609,"['Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'MHC Class II Genes', 'MHC class II transactivator protein', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Research Design', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disorder risk', 'gene interaction', 'genetic pedigree', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'secondary outcome', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2009,30803,148186688,0.06437895007936896
"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism. Results of this study are expected to help identify sets of genes that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to substance dependence, leading to improved diagnosis and management of addiction based on an individualized treatment approach.           Project Narrative: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7617627,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,175000,327644200,0.05739443740218531
"Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this project are to develop novel statistical methods and computer packages for cancer classification and survival analysis using high-dimensional gene expression data and clinical measurements. For studying the layered complexity of cancer, gene expression prowling using micro arrays and statistical analysis offers a powerful tool as it allows analysis of gene expression patterns in a genome-wide scale. As expression pro ling technologies mature and more and more massive data are being generated, the identification of statistically and biologically significant patterns from high- dimensional and noisy data sets is increasingly becoming a major challenge. There is an urgent need to develop statistical methods that can deal with such high-dimensional problems in linking the clinical outcomes and gene expression pro les, for better diagnosis of disease status, better prescription of treatment, and better survival prediction in cancer. In this project, we will use the basic principles of cancer genetics to guide our efforts in developing novel methods and models for analyzing data from cancer expression prowling studies. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop bridge penalized method for variable selection and estimation for high-dimensional models that have important applications in gene expression prowling studies of cancer. (2) Develop group-bridge penalized method for incorporating biological pathways into the analysis of gene expression data. (3) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for tumor classification and biomarker selection using gene expression data, with emphasis on regularized logistic regression and semi-parametric ROC classification methods for improved sensitivity and specificity, while adjusting for other clinical covariates and risk factors. (4) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for correlating survival with gene expression data, while adjusting for other clinical measurements and risk factors. Important models to consider include the linear and partially linear Cox proportional hazards models and the linear and partially linear accelerated failure time models. (5) Implement the proposed methods in well documented R packages and C programs; evaluate these methods by extensive computer simulation studies and by use of publicly available data sets; and apply them to two expression prowling studies of lymphoma and head and neck cancers. The development of the proposed statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in estimating the relationship between cancer clinical outcomes and genomic data will contribute to better understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction, which in turn, can potentially have important impact on public health.             n/a",Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer,7548118,R01CA120988,"['Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cations', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Iowa', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Property', 'Prowl', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer microarray', 'college', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2009,287156,193405667,0.011346710438066579
"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7682282,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,291480,507546965,0.06626036218743504
"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7935041,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2009,305756,175892898,0.06558243457629866
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7507028,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2009,322622,10786285,0.028677491536272175
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders. All of the binding motifs, potential target genes, related SNPs and networks will be catalogued in the on-line resource PAZAR, a public database of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation (http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/index.pl), and the NIH-funded Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) (http://www.nursa.org/). Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. The recent sequencing of the human genome has allowed us to identify new genes associated with these diseases at an ever increasing rate. In this study we apply the latest high throughput technology to help identify variations in the genetic sequence that might be related to those (and other) diseases by examining the regulatory regions of genes and the proteins that bind those regions. Our work will help bring us closer to an era of personalized medicine in which prevention, diagnosis and treatment are tailored to the individual patient, making them more effective and less costly.           Project Narrative Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7629191,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,448088,685608202,0.052562867971587005
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.           Project Narrative We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7650125,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'offspring']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,578836,607172798,0.024813447648320993
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.",Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer,7591560,R01CA131324,"['African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Control Groups', 'County', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Carcinogens', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hispanics', 'Histologic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant Squamous Cell Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Mutagens', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Squamous Cell', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States', 'adduct', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'plasmid DNA', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,595463,175892898,0.039353826416904984
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies. The methodology described in this proposal is a powerful new approach to maximize the information learned from large datasets to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases of public health interest.",Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations,7642231,R01LM010040,"['Architecture', 'Arts', 'Base Pairing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Models', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,922959,117374875,0.041857297714408395
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7591153,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2009,1090595,175892898,0.06558243457629866
"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Role of the MHC Class II tranactivator gene in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator gene (MHC2TA) on chromosome 16p13has recently emerged as the single most important transcription factor for regulation of genes required for class II MHC-restricted antigen presentation. This study will test the hypothesis that genetic variation inMHC2TA is associated with susceptibility to SLE and RA, and that this variation may interact with one or more SLE-associated and RA-associated MHC class II alleles to influence disease risk and secondary phenotypes. The broad long-term objectives are to examine the potential role of MHC2TA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and secondary phenotypes in conjunction with known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk haplotypes. The specific aims are to genotype over thirty well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MHC2TA gene region will be genotyped in 1,000 Caucasian RA families and 1,000 Caucasian SLE families to identify specific alleles, genotypes and haplotypes associated with RA and SLE risk. Family-based association tests, conditional linkage disequilibrium approaches and conditional logistic regression modeling will be performed to identify potential genetic interactions and disease risk modifying effects within this genomic region. Due to the strong relationship of lupus nephritis (LN) to SLE morbidity and mortality, LN will be studied as an important secondary outcome in the SLE families. Associations with specific RA phenotypes (rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positivity, and erosive disease) in the RA families will also be examined. One of the major strengths of this study is the family-based research design, which will reduce the problem of population stratification often present in genetic case-control studies. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases with a tremendous societal and economic burden. The genetic contribution of the MHC class II gene region is known to be substantial. A better understanding of variation within the MHC class II transactivator gene and how it influences risk and/or phenotypic expression may help lead to improved methods of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.           n/a",Role of the MHC Class II tranactivator gene in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis,7409764,F31AI075609,"['Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Erythematosus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'MHC class II transactivator protein', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Research Design', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disorder risk', 'gene interaction', 'genetic pedigree', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2008,30803,148186688,0.06437895007936896
"Synergism of Gene and Environment in Cancer Studies: A New Bayesian Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The past decade has witnessed the growing importance of statistical planning and inferential techniques in providing solutions to complex problems in medical and health sciences. Two scientific teams are currently dominating clinical medicine and public health: the molecular biology approach with an emphasis on genetics, and the quantitative approach with an emphasis on epidemiology. The developments in these areas jointly are making fundamental contributions to the study of cancer. This application lies in that new interface of human genetics, epidemiology and statistics in cancer research. Case-control studies are being increasingly used for studying the association between a disease and a candidate gene. However, except for some rare diseases, such as Huntington or Tay Sachs disease which may be the result of a deficiency of a single gene product, most common human diseases like cancer have a multifactorial etiology involving complex interplay of many genetic and environ- mental factors. By identifying and characterizing such complicated gene-environment interactions through clinical and epidemiological studies, one has more opportunities to study etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of complex diseases. In case-control studies of gene-environment association with disease, when genetic and environmental exposures can be assumed to be independent in the underlying population, one may exploit the independence in order to derive more efficient estimation techniques than the traditional logistic regression analysis. Many of the classical results for case- control analysis, which assume the covariate distribution to be non-parametric, do not hold under a constrained space of exposure distributions. However, the gain in efficiency of modern retrospective methods comes at the cost of lack of robustness, since large biases are introduced in the retrospective estimates under violation of the gene-environment independence assumption. The main objective of this research application is to find a natural analytical tool to solve the model specification dilemma of modern retrospective analysis of studies of gene-environment interaction, under three commonly used epidemiological designs. We posit the problem in a Bayesian framework that incorporates uncertainty regarding the assumed constraint of gene-environment independence in a natural data adaptive way. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed estimator is still able to maintain attractive efficiency properties, without relying on unverifiable model constraints. Epidemiologists have often anguished whether to use the case-control or the case-only estimator of gene-environment interaction for a given study, and the current application tries to resolve the question in a novel Bayesian framework. The methods developed may be routinely applied to various epidemiological studies of gene-environment interaction.             n/a",Synergism of Gene and Environment in Cancer Studies: A New Bayesian Approach,7476554,R03CA130045,"['Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cations', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contraceptive Usage', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oral', 'Oral Contraceptives', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Tay-Sachs Disease', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human disease', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2008,71840,641965656,0.03662411226295127
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7418308,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,162196,148186688,0.0502161195189482
"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7509667,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Week', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2008,175000,327644200,0.05739443740218531
"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution.

"Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this project are to develop novel statistical methods and computer packages for cancer classification and survival analysis using high-dimensional gene expression data and clinical measurements. For studying the layered complexity of cancer, gene expression prowling using micro arrays and statistical analysis offers a powerful tool as it allows analysis of gene expression patterns in a genome-wide scale. As expression pro ling technologies mature and more and more massive data are being generated, the identification of statistically and biologically significant patterns from high- dimensional and noisy data sets is increasingly becoming a major challenge. There is an urgent need to develop statistical methods that can deal with such high-dimensional problems in linking the clinical outcomes and gene expression pro les, for better diagnosis of disease status, better prescription of treatment, and better survival prediction in cancer. In this project, we will use the basic principles of cancer genetics to guide our efforts in developing novel methods and models for analyzing data from cancer expression prowling studies. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop bridge penalized method for variable selection and estimation for high-dimensional models that have important applications in gene expression prowling studies of cancer. (2) Develop group-bridge penalized method for incorporating biological pathways into the analysis of gene expression data. (3) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for tumor classification and biomarker selection using gene expression data, with emphasis on regularized logistic regression and semi-parametric ROC classification methods for improved sensitivity and specificity, while adjusting for other clinical covariates and risk factors. (4) Develop bridge and group-bridge penalized methods for correlating survival with gene expression data, while adjusting for other clinical measurements and risk factors. Important models to consider include the linear and partially linear Cox proportional hazards models and the linear and partially linear accelerated failure time models. (5) Implement the proposed methods in well documented R packages and C programs; evaluate these methods by extensive computer simulation studies and by use of publicly available data sets; and apply them to two expression prowling studies of lymphoma and head and neck cancers. The development of the proposed statistical methods that can deal with high-dimensional problems in estimating the relationship between cancer clinical outcomes and genomic data will contribute to better understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, better diagnoses, and better survival prediction, which in turn, can potentially have important impact on public health.             n/a",Regularized Classification & Survival Analysis for Expression Profiling of Cancer,7371702,R01CA120988,"['Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cations', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Iowa', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Property', 'Prowl', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer microarray', 'college', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2008,299301,193405667,0.011346710438066579
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7445536,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,467804,685608202,0.052562867971587005
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             n/a",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7467185,R01CA070759,"['Abbreviations', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Budgets', 'CDKN1A gene', 'CHEK2 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cyclin D1', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Individual', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'MDM2 gene', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Proteolysis', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STK6 gene', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoke', 'Specimen', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cdc Genes', 'early onset', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'homologous recombination', 'mutation carrier', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'p27 Cell Cycle Protein', 'p27 Enzyme Inhibitor', 'peripheral blood', 'protein protein interaction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2008,493284,175892898,0.03175504294170501
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7478414,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,577197,607172798,0.024813447648320993
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,7385160,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2008,649860,90419233,0.09187033107835388
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7387530,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2008,1077416,175892898,0.06558243457629866
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"WormBase: a core data resource for C elegans and other nematodes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caenorhabditis elegans is a major model system for basic biological and biomedical research and the first animal for which there is a complete description of its genome, anatomy and development, and some information about each of its ~22,000 genes. Five years of funding is requested to maintain and expand WormBase, a Model Organism Database (MOD), with complete coverage of core genomic, genetic, anatomical and functional information about this and other nematodes. Such a database is necessary to allow the entire biomedical research community to make full use of nematode genomic sequences. The two top priorities will be intensive data curation and user interface improvement. WormBase will include up-to-date annotation of the genomic data, the current genetic and physical maps and many experimental data such as genome-scale datasets connected to the function and interactions of cells and genes, as well as development, physiology and behavior. Direct access to the sources of biological material, such as the strain collection of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and direct links to data sets maintained by others will be provided. Data will be recovered from the existing resources, from direct contribution of the individual laboratories, and from the literature. While WormBase will act as a central forum through which every laboratory will be able to contribute constructively to the global effort to fully comprehend this metazoan organism, WormBase professional curators will ensure detailed attribution of data sources and check consistency and integrity. To facilitate communication, WormBase will use technology, terminology and style concordant with other databases wherever possible. WormBase will maintain ontologies for nematode anatomy and phenotypes. WormBase will be Web-based and easy to use. Multiple relational databases will be used for data management; the object-based Acedb database system will be used for integration, and this integrated database plus ""slave"" relational databases will be used to drive the website. Coordination of the project and the main curation site will be at Caltech under the supervision of a C. elegans biologist. Curation and annotation of genomic sequence will take place at the centers - the Sanger Institute and Washington University - that generated the entire genome sequence. Oxford University will maintain genetic nomenclature.  Nematodes (roundworms) are major parasites of humans, livestock and crops, and extension of WormBase to broader coverage of nematode genomics will facilitate research into the diagnosis and treatment of nematode-based disease.

"Genetic and Environmental Modifiers of Parkinson Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson Disease (PD) affects approximately one million Americans (Olanow et al. 1998). Considering peak incidence occurs between ages 55 and 66 (McDonald et al. 2003) and the U.S. population is aging, PD prevalence and ensuing societal costs are expected to rise. Deciphering the etiology of PD to improve its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention is a societal goal of utmost importance. As genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the disease process, investigation into genetic susceptibility requires consideration for environmental modifiers. With a large collection of PD families, candidate genes of the nitric oxide synthesizing family will be examined with family-based association tests; associations between PD risk and environmental factors that demonstrate a biologically plausible link to the candidate genes will be assessed; and interactions between the genetic and environmental factors will then be analyzed. Since the most appropriate method for genetic and environmental association and interaction analyses with family- based data is not yet established, an empirical comparison of conditional logistic regression and generalized estimating equations will be performed to propose the most appropriate analytic tool in this context.           n/a",Genetic and Environmental Modifiers of Parkinson Disease,7278177,F31NS056632,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biological', 'Caffeine', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'human NOS3 protein', 'improved', 'neurotoxic', 'pesticide exposure', 'sex', 'simulation', 'size', 'tool']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,15579,607172798,0.03069324059873637
"Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array Text mining applications seek to alleviate the problems with identifying, searching, and extracting relevant information from large sets of literature. The goal of this proposal is to create a text mining application to extract protein point mutations from biomedical literature. The developed application will be used to extract point mutations from literature discussing human genetic disorders, and the retrieved database of point mutations used to design a DMA microarray chip for prenatal genetic diagnosis. First, the text mining application will be developed using machine learning and statistical natural language processing techniques. Second, the point mutation mining application will be applied to a large set of literature related to genetic disorders, and the retrieved point mutations deposited in an electronic database. This collection of point mutations will be examined to find polymorphisms in genes that are markers for genetic disorders. These polymorphic positions in the human genome will be gathered and used to design a DMA microarray chip that can genotype tens of thousands of single nucelotide polymorphisms. The microarray chip can be used for prenatal genetic diagnosis purposes to screen for hundreds of genetic disorders. n/a",Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array,7156197,F37LM008883,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,F37,2007,45812,0,0.02953391861398855
"Synergism of Gene and Environment in Cancer Studies: A New Bayesian Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The past decade has witnessed the growing importance of statistical planning and inferential techniques in providing solutions to complex problems in medical and health sciences. Two scientific teams are currently dominating clinical medicine and public health: the molecular biology approach with an emphasis on genetics, and the quantitative approach with an emphasis on epidemiology. The developments in these areas jointly are making fundamental contributions to the study of cancer. This application lies in that new interface of human genetics, epidemiology and statistics in cancer research. Case-control studies are being increasingly used for studying the association between a disease and a candidate gene. However, except for some rare diseases, such as Huntington or Tay Sachs disease which may be the result of a deficiency of a single gene product, most common human diseases like cancer have a multifactorial etiology involving complex interplay of many genetic and environ- mental factors. By identifying and characterizing such complicated gene-environment interactions through clinical and epidemiological studies, one has more opportunities to study etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of complex diseases. In case-control studies of gene-environment association with disease, when genetic and environmental exposures can be assumed to be independent in the underlying population, one may exploit the independence in order to derive more efficient estimation techniques than the traditional logistic regression analysis. Many of the classical results for case- control analysis, which assume the covariate distribution to be non-parametric, do not hold under a constrained space of exposure distributions. However, the gain in efficiency of modern retrospective methods comes at the cost of lack of robustness, since large biases are introduced in the retrospective estimates under violation of the gene-environment independence assumption. The main objective of this research application is to find a natural analytical tool to solve the model specification dilemma of modern retrospective analysis of studies of gene-environment interaction, under three commonly used epidemiological designs. We posit the problem in a Bayesian framework that incorporates uncertainty regarding the assumed constraint of gene-environment independence in a natural data adaptive way. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed estimator is still able to maintain attractive efficiency properties, without relying on unverifiable model constraints. Epidemiologists have often anguished whether to use the case-control or the case-only estimator of gene-environment interaction for a given study, and the current application tries to resolve the question in a novel Bayesian framework. The methods developed may be routinely applied to various epidemiological studies of gene-environment interaction.             n/a",Synergism of Gene and Environment in Cancer Studies: A New Bayesian Approach,7320214,R03CA130045,"['Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cations', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contraceptive Usage', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oral', 'Oral Contraceptives', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Tay-Sachs Disease', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human disease', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R03,2007,71840,0,0.03662411226295127
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that one of the mosl powerful techniques for determining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are clear. Similarly, genpmic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has two primary research goals. One is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS)highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for detecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HOT). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research.In pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional- annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution.

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7290450,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,568393,607172798,0.024813447648320993

"ACQUIRED & GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify links between specific environmental exposures and/or specific gene alleles, and multiple sclerosis onset and progression.  A cohort of 1294 pairs of North American twins affected by multiple sclerosis was assembled from 1980-92, detailed medical records, exposure and disability information were gathered independently from affected and unaffected individuals, and follow-up for new diagnoses and new records has subsequently proceeded.  An additional set of 195 pairs of affected California native resident twins has been identified within a cohort of 41,000 twins participating in a population-based registry.  The up-date on all cases will be completed, diagnoses will be systematically validated using the additional records, and age-specific disability information will be gathered.  Blood specimens from both members of each pair and from specific family members as controls will be collected.  The affected twins will be compared to their unaffected co-twins with respect to historical evidence of infection and other exposures and characteristics such as reproductive evidences of endogenous estrogen production.  Cases will be compared to both co-twins and family member controls with respect to serological evidence of past infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae and members of the herpes virus family.  We will compare cases to relatives with respect to the prevalence of alleles at the HLA (DR) locus as well as at various other candidate loci, found by genome-wide screening or that affect immune competence, myelin basic protein, and other pertinent functions.  Within the set of cases only, both environmental and genetic factors will be assessed as determinants of age at onset and age-specific progression.  If links to both acquired exposure and genome are identified, given adequate power, specific gene- environment interactions will be assessed.  Analyses for both etiology and progression will consist of logistic regression and sub-analyses stratified on gender, zygosity, and HLA (DR) status.

"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors.

To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.

"Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array DESCRIPTION:    Text mining applications seek to alleviate the problems with identifying, searching, and extracting relevant information from large sets of literature. The goal of this proposal is to create a text mining application to extract protein point mutations from biomedical literature. The developed application will be used to extract point mutations from literature discussing human genetic disorders, and the retrieved database of point mutations used to design a DNA microarray chip for prenatal genetic diagnosis. First, the text mining application will be developed using machine learning and statistical natural language processing techniques. Second, the point mutation mining application will be applied to a large set of literature related to genetic disorders, and the retrieved point mutations deposited in an electronic database. This collection of point mutations will be examined to find polymorphisms in genes that are markers for genetic disorders. These polymorphic positions in the human genome will be gathered and used to design a DMA microarray chip that can genotype tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The microarray chip can be used for prenatal genetic diagnosis purposes to screen for hundreds of genetic disorders. n/a",Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array,6993320,F37LM008883,"['biotechnology', 'information retrieval', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'point mutation', 'predoctoral investigator', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,F37,2005,45812,0,0.030424359921330062
"Candidate Gene Analysis/Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis Craniosynostosis, the premature closure of one or more cranial sutures, occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 live births.  More than 85% of all craniosynostosis cases are thought to be nonsyndromic, i.e., not associated with other congenital anomalies or with known mutations in the genes causing craniosynostosis syndromes. Identification of genes causing nonsyndromic craniosynostosis will allow better understanding of the complex process of calvarial formation and will open new venues for study of normal and abnormal development of the skull. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic markers and their use has become a major tool for the detection of genetic linkage and disease associations. New genotyping technologies that are available to us allow rapid and highly sensitive genotyping of a large set of SNPs in or near candidate genes. We propose to perform genetic association and linkage analysis on a group of candidate genes selected on the basis of their biologic function, expression pattern, or observed phenotype. Our group has identified candidate genes, characterized SNPs and has already successfully genotyped 48 families with craniosynostosis. Associations with several candidate genes have been established. A panel of SNPs validated in our laboratory will be applied on a set of DNA samples from more than 200 well-characterized craniosynostosis families. The SNP genotypes will allow comparison of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and haplotypes at the candidate gene loci. The specific aims for this study are: 1) to perform SNP genotype analysis of a large set of DNA samples for 750-1000 SNPs located within or near 50 craniosynostosis candidate genes; 2) to perform case-parent trio based allelic and haplotype Transmission Disequilibrium Tests (TDTs) to test for associations in the presence of linkage between marker loci and nonsyndromic craniosynostosis; and 3) to test for gene-gene interaction using conditional logistic regression analysis. This new information will lead to better strategies for diagnosis and management of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis.         n/a",Candidate Gene Analysis/Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis,6851867,R03DE016342,"['bone development', 'clinical research', 'computed axial tomography', 'craniosynostosis', 'developmental disease /disorder', 'family genetics', 'gene expression', 'gene frequency', 'gene interaction', 'gene mutation', 'genetic markers', 'genetic screening', 'genetic susceptibility', 'high throughput technology', 'human genetic material tag', 'human subject', 'linkage disequilibriums', 'linkage mapping', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'quantitative trait loci', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'skull']",NIDCR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,81750,807432003,0.07031222797460741

"Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a near complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior at the molecular and cellular levels.  The ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function such as addiction.  However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely.  Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system functions, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of behavioral phenotypes.   The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the behavioral patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatment in C. elegans.  By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of uncoordinated, locomotion-abnormal mutants, these tools will be particularly useful for correlation specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns.  These analytical tools will also be used to precisely define the long-term effects of neuroactive drugs on behavioral, opening the possibility of genetic screening for mutants with defects in tolerance and dependence. n/a",Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.,6647233,R21DA015823,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', ' automated data processing', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug addiction', ' gene mutation', ' genetic screening', ' genome', ' invertebrate locomotion', ' mutant', ' neural transmission', ' neurophysiology', ' neuropsychology', ' nicotine', ' nicotinic receptors', ' phenotype', ' substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R21,2003,152000,0,0.01779313670115834

"ACQUIRED & GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify links between specific environmental exposures and/or specific gene alleles, and multiple sclerosis onset and progression.  A cohort of 1294 pairs of North American twins affected by multiple sclerosis was assembled from 1980-92, detailed medical records, exposure and disability information were gathered independently from affected and unaffected individuals, and follow-up for new diagnoses and new records has subsequently proceeded.  An additional set of 195 pairs of affected California native resident twins has been identified within a cohort of 41,000 twins participating in a population-based registry.  The up-date on all cases will be completed, diagnoses will be systematically validated using the additional records, and age-specific disability information will be gathered.  Blood specimens from both members of each pair and from specific family members as controls will be collected.  The affected twins will be compared to their unaffected co-twins with respect to historical evidence of infection and other exposures and characteristics such as reproductive evidences of endogenous estrogen production.  Cases will be compared to both co-twins and family member controls with respect to serological evidence of past infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae and members of the herpes virus family.  We will compare cases to relatives with respect to the prevalence of alleles at the HLA (DR) locus as well as at various other candidate loci, found by genome-wide screening or that affect immune competence, myelin basic protein, and other pertinent functions.  Within the set of cases only, both environmental and genetic factors will be assessed as determinants of age at onset and age-specific progression.  If links to both acquired exposure and genome are identified, given adequate power, specific gene- environment interactions will be assessed.  Analyses for both etiology and progression will consist of logistic regression and sub-analyses stratified on gender, zygosity, and HLA (DR) status. Additional descriptive evidence of environmental etiology will also be sought.  n/a",ACQUIRED & GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,6383894,R01NS040194,"['Herpesviridae disease', ' chlamydial disease', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' disease /disorder onset', ' estrogens', ' family genetics', ' gene environment interaction', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genetic susceptibility', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' human subject', ' immunogenetics', ' major histocompatibility complex', ' medical records', ' multiple sclerosis', ' myelin basic proteins', ' nervous system disorder epidemiology', ' patient oriented research', ' remission /regression', ' twin /multiplet']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2001,360008,324592664,0.03333824234516526
"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.  This study builds on a unique existing resource to study genetic and environmental associations with colorectal cancer.  It will provide insight into colon cancer etiology and therefore avenues to disease prevention.  n/a",Growth Factors and Colon Cancer,6370654,R01CA085846,"['apolipoprotein E', ' aspirin', ' calcium', ' cancer prevention', ' carcinogenesis', ' cell growth regulation', ' cell proliferation', ' colon neoplasms', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' gene environment interaction', ' genetic susceptibility', ' growth factor', ' informatics', ' information systems', ' insulin', ' insulin receptor', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition related tag', ' peroxisome proliferator activated receptor', ' somatotropin', ' vitamin D', ' vitamin D receptors']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2001,692093,228951281,-0.03271204635130888
"CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): Bold steps must be       taken to advance our understanding of the genetic and associated co-             variates affecting the inheritance of complex diseases. To that end, this        proposal will develop improved quantitative methods to detect genetic            factors contributing to increased susceptibility to complex disorders and        implement these methods in software for distribution to the research             community.                                                                                                                                                        The methods will concentrate on the use of classification techniques             applied to allele sharing data and other risk factors which affect the           trait. Allele sharing methods for mapping genes will be extended to              include the classification methods known as latent class models, cluster         analysis, and artificial neural networks, as well as a novel use of              logistic regression Co-variates such as gender, parental diagnosis, or           other concomitant factors will be systematically studied through                 applications to both stimulated and existing data sets. An additional goal       is to determine the optimal distribution of relative pairs (e.g. siblings,       first cousins) for these methods. Of great importance to this proposal is        the development of well-documented, user-friendly software and                   documentation which will be distributed to the scientific community via          the Internet. Existing software developed by the PI will be extensively          expanded for latent class models. Existing cluster analysis software will        be modified and combined for ease of use.                                                                                                                         This proposal consists of theoretical exploration, computer simulation,          data analysis, and software development. First, solutions of theoretical         questions relating to classification techniques will be pursued; second,         adaptation of computer programs to implement the analytic methods, and           investigation into alternative research strategies will be accomplished.         The new strategies will be applied to stimulated data, and finally, to           existing data sets of pedigrees in which a complex trait has been                diagnosed. Findings from this research may contribute to the ability to          locate susceptibility loci in complex traits and to the clarification of         those etiological mechanisms responsible for susceptibility.                      n/a",CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI,6168495,R01AA012239,"['alleles', ' analytical method', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical resource', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' family genetics', ' gene environment interaction', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' quantitative trait loci', ' statistics /biometry']",NIAAA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,180260,533594881,0.026384474351064807
"MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety          Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence                      susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure          and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the               evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent        advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and                 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to        determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have           led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin             dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,           ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It         is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve                    heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic                components.                                                                                                                                                       The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in         the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic              features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of               inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be                 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which         are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of        inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular        pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods         using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to                 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A             number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will          be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and         other complex diseases, will be developed.  The results of our studies           are generally applicable to the mapping and characterization of complex          human genetic traits.                                                             n/a",MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS,6180774,R01GM056688,"['European', "" Hodgkin's disease"", ' MHC class I antigen', ' MHC class II antigen', ' T cell receptor', ' alleles', ' antiserum', ' artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' celiac disease', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer data analysis', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' gene frequency', ' genetic counseling', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic markers', ' genetic models', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genotype', ' hereditary hemochromatosis', ' heterozygote', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' histocompatibility gene', ' homozygote', ' human genetic material tag', ' human population genetics', ' immunogenetics', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' linkage disequilibriums', ' mathematical model', ' molecular genetics', ' multiple sclerosis', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' oligonucleotides', ' restriction fragment length polymorphism', ' rheumatoid arthritis', ' serotyping', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2000,283617,148186688,0.04798643590691095
